" Apple's product concentration is both a risk and opportunity . The tech company is exploring new categories with spatial computing and artificial intelligence . New product categories strengthen the flywheel effect of Apple's cohesive ecosystem of hardware, software, and services .  Just three product categories -- iPhone, Mac, and iPad -- account for about two-thirds of Apple's annual sales . The remaining sales come from Apple's services segment, which is diversified across a range of services .  Apple generates about $300 billion worth of product sales annually from just four product categories . A single successful new product would be a likely major tailwind for the company . The company's sales growth rates could materially accelerate if Apple sees success in a new product category .  Apple is already venturing into new product categories that could morph into major revenue streams in the future . Every new product has a flywheel effect on other areas of the business, too .

Apple stock's price-to-earnings ratio of about 31 seems to price in a return to higher growth rates at some point in the future . Still, the risks are significant. For instance, it's possible Apple's sales growth rates will never return to robust high-single-digit rates .

" Alphabet’s valuation is sharply lower than that of its mega-cap, tech-focused peers . It has a diversified business but is still heavily dependent on Google Search . However, competition could actually benefit Alphabet in the long run .  The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is simply the price of a stock divided by earnings per share over the last 12 months . The P/E ratio has some major flaws . Smoothing out the ratio by comparing it to historical averages over a period of time can be effective ways to get a better reading on a company's profitability .

Google Search brought in over $50 billion in revenue, which made up 65.6% of total services revenue . The sheer size of Google Search compared to YouTube illustrates the company's dependence on Google Search .  Google Search's seemingly impenetrable moat has been threatened by other information resources such as ChatGPT, Claude, TikTok, and Meta Platforms' Instagram . Given the rapid adoption of these tools, it's not unreasonable to assume that time spent on Google Search may decrease .

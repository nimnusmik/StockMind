" U.S. companies remain largely in the dark on when they’ll receive crucial magnets from China . President Donald Trump declared a “done” trade deal with Beijing 10 days ago . Many American firms that need Chinese minerals are still waiting on Beijing’s approval for shipments .  Some firms wait for magnets and others face restrictions selling to China . That friction risks derailing a fragile tariff truce clinched by Washington and Beijing last month .  Trump last month restricted US firms from exporting chip software, jet engines and a key ingredient to make plastic to China . Companies subject to Washington’s curbs have halted billions of dollars in planned shipments as they wait for players in unrelated sectors to secure permits from Beijing .  Energy and chemical giant INEOS Group Holdings SA has one tanker full of ethane waiting to go, while Enterprise Products Partners has three to four cargo ships stuck in limbo . China has adequate ethane supplies in reserve and can switch to using naphtha from the Middle East and other regions for much of their production .  Access to rare earths is an issue “that is going to continue to metastasize until there is resolution” China only agreed to grant licenses — if at all — for six months, before companies need to reapply for approvals . Firms doing business in the US and China could see recurring interruptions .  The terms of the deal were never publicized in writing by either side . Beijing still hasn't officially spelled out the deal’s requirements, nor has Xi publicly signaled his endorsement of it . Complicating the issue, companies often buy magnets from third-party suppliers, which serve defense and auto firms .  China’s Commerce Ministry is working to facilitate more approvals even as it asks for reams of information on how the materials will be used, people say . Some companies have been asked to supply data including detailed product designs, one of the people said . Chinese officials have expedited shipments for some major US and European automakers since Trump announced the agreement .  Trump’s agreement “will allow for rare earths to flow out of the country for a short period of time,” Hammer said . “Nobody trusts that this thaw is going to last.” Ford Motor Co. says rare-earths licenses have already forced the company to temporarily shutter one plant .  The automaker has an exclusive deal to get the products from MP Materials Corp. in Texas, with production starting later in the year . It has another deal with eVAC of Germany to get magnets from a South Carolina plant starting in 2026 . Scout Motors CEO Scott Keogh said his company is re-engineering brakes and drive units to reduce the need for rare earths . Scout is building a plant in South Carolina to make fully electric and hybrid SUVs as well as trucks .  Restrictions on sales to China of electronic design automation software for chipmaking are emblematic of the standoff . Those tools are used to design everything, from the highest-end processors for the likes of Nvidia Corp. and Apple . Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the measures were used to ‘annoy’ China into complying with a deal US negotiators thought they’d already reached .  There’s worry that heightened geopolitical risks will push Chinese customers to hunt for other suppliers or further develop domestic capabilities . “The risk is there for the London deal to fall apart,” said chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis .",negative,"tariff, china, suppliers, shipments, beijing"
" US President Donald Trump signaled he would give diplomacy a chance before deciding whether to strike Iran . Iran maintained Friday it won’t negotiate with the US while an an an Iranian strike is imminent . “I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,” Trump said in dictated message .  Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian: Only way to end the imposed war is to “unconditionally stop” the enemy’s aggression . Oil prices fell following a report from Reuters that Iran is ready to discuss limitations on nuclear enrichment, but will not consider stopping entirely . That puts the country's leadership at odds with President Trump, who has called for zero enrichment .  Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen says Iran would be prevented from gaining atomic weapons regardless of whether the US joins the operation . Israel Defense Forces staged fresh strikes on dozens of targets, hitting missile-production sites and the Tehran headquarters of the nation’s internal security unit and research and development arm .  European equities climbed and oil fell 3% to temper gains from earlier in the week . Businesses operating in the region are wary the conflict could spread and engulf other countries . US airlines took the unusual step of suspending flights to countries such as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates .  Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is meeting counterparts from the UK, France and Germany on Friday afternoon in Geneva . French President Emmanuel Macron urged Iran to return to the negotiating table . UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said a window exists within the next two weeks to achieve a diplomatic solution .  Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani held separate phone calls with Rubio and Araghchi . German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed on Friday that deescalation was necessary and that Iran shouldn’t be allowed to possess nuclear weapons .

" In 2023, the flagship reveal at Apple’s WWDC keynote was unquestionably the debut of the Vision Pro . The Vision Pro would aspire to deliver general-purpose utility reminiscent of the Mac . Just in a radically new, immersive form .  Vision Pro took its place among the Apple platforms getting operating system updates in the fall . That’s not a sign of diminished relevance, though. The software upgrades keep Apple gear evolving and improving . And VisionOS 26'smeatiness makes for a striking contrast with the barely evolving Apple TV box .  In April, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurmanreported that Apple is working on two new headsets and that CEO Tim Cook is eager to release something in a more glasses-like form factor when the technology is ready . The upgrade, Sinclair told me, “adds new ways to connect. It unlocks new methods to interact with the spatial digital content that we have .  Personas are the photorealistic avatars that can appear in FaceTime calls and other forms of videoconferencing . Personas already received a significant upgrade last year, shortly after the Vision Pro shipped . The setup process remains the same in the new version .  Coming face-to-face with your own Persona might not be the most effective way to assess the feature . It's other people’s Personas you’ll see most of the time, and staring at an uncanny digital representation of yourself can be unnerving . Judging from my own Persona and glimpses of others, their realism seems to be in the same vicinity as the Meta research project that powered a2023 conversation between Mark Zuckerberg and Lex Fridman .  By tiptoeing ever closer to faithfully re-creating its customers as digital people, does Apple run the risk of creating an unsettlinguncanny valley effect? “The last thing I would want to see is for us to get so scared of that valley that we don't make the leaps ahead that we're making with the new version of Personas,” Norris says .  The ability to precisely stick widgets in your real-world environment is not in itself a killer feature . Plain old wall clocks still work quite well, no $3,500 headset required . But if you think ahead to a future in which AR is a bigger part of our lives, it starts to feel like table stakes .  VisionOS 26 adds native support for 180- and 360-degree video shot with cameras from GoPro, Insta360, and Canon . The results aren't in 3D, but the samples I saw in my demo, including a skydiving shot, were pretty breathtaking .  VisionOS 26's combination of eye tracking and hand gestures was simple to master and capable of more than you might expect . It's not a given that a wildly new product will get that right on its first attempt .  Numerous technical obstacles still stand in the way of anyone releasing comfy, affordable, power-efficient glasses that rival the Vision Pro’s capabilities . I’m still not positive thatanyone in the industrywill pull it off soon. Nor is it certain that the concept will ever reach smartphone-like ubiquity . Nevertheless, watching Apple use the vision Pro as a proving ground for some of the necessary building blocks right now is fun .  The Trump Organization is launching a $499 smartphone and branded wireless service . Analysts say the plan raises more questions than answers—and doubt it will find a real market . Reid Hoffman on Musk vs. Trump and the real AI threat to jobs .  Tools for Humanity’s World launched its first-ever ad campaign for human verification in an AI world .

" Apple may get surpassed by Amazon in market cap by the end of this year . Amazon has reason to grow its profits while Apple's may fall . The two stocks' valuations indicate that Amazon has the potential to surpass Apple . Here's why I predict Amazon stock will finish 2025 ahead of Apple in 2025 .  Amazon has grown its revenue by 102% in the last five years, compared to 46% for Apple . Amazon is growing faster than Apple at a larger revenue base, too, generating $650 billion in revenue over the last 12 months vs. $400 billion at Apple . The company plays in two huge addressable markets: e-commerce and cloud computing .  Amazon's supply chain is already optimized to the gills, posting 32% operating margins over the last 12 months . Apple's profit margins may move in the other direction if it gets hurt by tariff costs on imports to the U.S. from China . Another factor that could hurt Apple's profitability is looming lawsuits coming for its default search engine payment and App Store fees .  Apple's operating income of $127 billion greatly surpasses Amazon's $72 billion over the past 12 months . Amazon's operating margin will keep expanding along with its durable revenue growth . Apple's business is at risk of losing two huge cash cows that will dampen its overall profitability .  Amazon will finish the year ahead in market capitalization . Amazon will be valued more than Apple, and will finish ahead of Apple . Nvidia, Apple, Netflix and Netflix are all about to pop . Now is the best time to buy before it’s too late .

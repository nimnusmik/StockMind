" Apple’s once-glorified assistant has fallen way behind flashier AI like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude . After years of stunted updates and stiff competition from Google, OpenAI, and Amazon, Siri is potentially on the brink of a reinvention . Whispers suggest this gamble could pay off and finally turn Apple stock's fortunes around .  Siri was created by Apple in 2011 and has been missing in action since then . ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok have evolved into sharp, context-savvy bots . Apple tried to turn things around with its massive ‘Apple Intelligence” rebrand in mid-2024, backed by savvy on-device models .  Recent reports suggest that Siri’s brain power could potentially be outsourced, marking a major U-turn for a company that has looked to build everything in-house . Apple shares popped 2% on the news, with Apple stock in the green . The shake-up follows big leadership moves, too .  The company has reportedly asked OpenAI and Anthropic to train AI models that can run on Apple’s cloud servers . That essentially means a much faster rollout and fewer AI hiccups . Samsung used Google's Gemini for its smartphones and Amazon's Alexa tapped Anthropic's Claude . Apple's already shelling out billions to run its own models in the cloud starting next year .  The stock market is down more than 17% year to date, and close to 18% in the past six months alone . It’s down 17% this year, and 18% since the start of the year .

" Anthropic stands in contention to power Apple's new version of Siri . The company notched an early court victory over a copyright lawsuit with implications for AI's future .  Meta recently invested $14 billion in data-labeling startup Scale AI . Zuckerberg has offered as much as $100 million to pull outside talent into the Meta fold . Zuckerberg had reportedly tried to acquire AI startup Safe Superintelligence .  It's harder to refute just how massively capable AI has become and how the conversation around it has broadened . If Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and the rest continue down their path of ever-increasing power, what exactly differentiates them from each other? What happens when AI becomes a commodity like the internet or even a search engine? Perhaps this is why Apple is content to take this route .  Innovation isn't cheap, but when you've been the most valuable company for years, you can probably afford to just buy it . The tech giant's innovation was unnecessary, but it's not the first time innovation has come to fruition .",neutral,"ai, innovation, apple, superintelligence, zuckerberg"
" Arm Holdings is best known for power-efficient CPU architecture . Through its CPU architecture licensing, Arm has broad exposure to AI growth . The stock seemed to gain on Apple's WWDC conference . Its valuation could put pressure on the stock from here .  Arm is sensitive to signs that the U.S. economy is resilient, according to data . The company is also sensitive to the economic cycle, which can drive demand . One of Arm's best days last month came from Apple's Developer Conference .  Arm stock has fallen over the first two days of July as the valuation is arguably stretched following last week's gains . The company's competitive advantages are formidable due to its technological edge in power efficiency . Guggenheim maintained a buy rating on the stock and raised its price target from $147 to $187 .  Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,045% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to178% for the S&P 500 .

" Meta Platforms (META) is the best-performing constituent of the group, all of whose members are artificial intelligence (AI) plays in their own right . Earlier this year, I noted that Meta looks like the best AI play among the group . In this article, we’ll analyze whether the Mark Zuckerberg-led company still earns that title .  Meta raised its 2025 capex guidance to between $64 billion and $72 billion . Last month, Meta acquired a 49% stake in Scale AI, hiring its founder, Alexandr Wang, along with other key employees in the process .  Zuckerberg said that Meta is “uniquely positioned to deliver superintelligence to the world” and highlighted the progress in wearables and AI glasses . Meta is making incremental progress in AI and is adding more AI features to its WhatsApp business suite . The company has hired several AI executives from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic .  Meta now trades very close to its mean target price of $722.96, even as it still has a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” from the 54 analysts actively covering the stock . Zuckerberg: AI will lead to better user engagement and “improved advertising”  Meta has seen a re-rating as markets give a thumbs up to its AI strategy . The multiples will taper down as AI initiatives start adding to Meta's profit pool . The next big story for the company could be AI glasses, and while these haven't flown off the shelf yet, many believe that glasses could be the next prominent computing platform after smartphones .",neutral,"ai, zuckerberg, meta, intelligence, superintelligence"

" Many investors shy away from “defensive” stocks like mobile providers because they don’t offer the potential for huge gains . But these are the very stocks that investors turn to during recessionsor market sell-offs precisely because of their stocks .

To remain in the market, money often flows to stocks like Verizon and AT&T, which may drop only a little bit or perhaps even rise when momentum stocks are crashing .

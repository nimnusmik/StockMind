" UK's alternative investment market (AIM) has struggled to attract and retain companies in recent years . Launched on 19 June 1995, AIM was set up to help smaller and high-growth companies get more access to capital . Well-known companies that started out on AIM include Jet2, ASOS and Fevertree .  45% of the capital raised on European growth markets over the past five years raised on AIM, according to the London Stock Exchange . In 2023, AIM companies contributed £68bn in gross value added to the UK economy .  61 companies representing £12.3bn of market capitalisation have announced plans to leave the junior market . If all of these moves go ahead, AIM is set to shrink by 20% .  Experts shared why AIM is struggling and what could be done to help revive the junior market . Jason Hollands, managing director at Bestinvest by Evelyn Partners, said that the sharp decline in companies on AIM largely reflects a wider malaise facing European markets for small and medium sized growth stocks in recent years .  The focus has been on a relatively small group of mega-cap growth US stocks — the ""Magnificent 7"", which is made up of Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) In addition, Hollands said that smaller companies have had to contend with the impact of thepandemic, thecost of living crisis, along with increases in financing costs .  The rise of venture capital and private equity has meant that public markets are playing a smaller part in fundraising globally . Initial public offerings raised $126bn in 2024 — a marginal increase on 2023, though that is well below the $211bn raised in 2018 .  Historically, if investors held AIM shares for at least two years at the time of death, they would be exempt from IHT because they qualified for business property relief . However, changes to IHT in the Autumn budgetmeant that the rate of relief was halved from 100% to 50% .  The Mansion House Accord is a government agreement with UK's largest workplace pension schemes to invest 10% into private markets by 2030, at least half of which has to be in the UK . ""Perception can often count when it comes to interest in certain sectors,"" says Hargreaves Lansdown .  Wealth Club's Hyett said uncertainty over IHT relief ""needs to be resolved and as soon as possible"" ""While the uncertainty remains, the flow of money into AIM will be stifled and the government risks slowly throttling the UK’s growth market,"" he said .",neutral,"market, investors, stocks, investment, invest"
" Taiwan joins a yearslong US campaign to curtail China's technological ascent when it blacklisted the country's AI and chipmaking champions . Taipei this month added Huawei Technologies Co. and its main chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. to its entity list . It was the first time Taiwanese officials have used that blacklist to sanction major Chinese firms .  President Donald Trump’s administration has urged Taipei to take more ownership over chip restrictions on China, people familiar with the matter said . The move marks Taipei's first public action on semiconductor restrictions since President Lai Ching-te pledged in April to address concerns from Washington .  Lai didn’t specify in April what steps Taiwan would take in response to US concerns . It’s unclear whether the Huawei and SMIC sanctions are related to ongoing tariff negotiations with Washington . Analyst: “This recent shift marks a substantive move toward strategic technological competition with China""  The US has pressured Taiwan to do more since Trump’s first term, when officials urged Taipei to block sales of chips to China . China opposes the US politicizing tech and trade issues, overstretching the concept of national security .  Last year, TSMC unwittingly manufactured 2.9 million AI dies for Huawei, based on estimates from researchers . Those semiconductors were routed via an intermediary that has since been sanctioned by the US government and cut off by TSMC .  Taiwanese companies were helping Huawei build infrastructure for an under-the-radar network of chip plants across southern China . Taiwanese officials said they would probe into those companies shortly after, but they’ve refrained from taking significant action . Taiwan’s entity list action doesn’t immediately upend routine business .  Lai has been working to reduce economic interdependence between China and Taiwan . His party released a video over the weekend arguing that Taiwanese companies should look to diversify away from China . Tensions escalated after Lai was elected last year . Beijing has accused him of seeking independence and destabilizing the region .  Taiwan’s annual investment in China peaked at $14.6 billion in 2010 . China claims the self-governing democracy is its territory and has vowed to unify with Taiwan, using force if necessary .

" The Trump administration is pressing ahead with another tariff barrage that some trade experts say is more legally sound than the president’s country-by-country duties . The Commerce Department is set within weeks to announce the outcomes of its investigations into sectors deemed vital to national security . The probes are widely expected to result in levies on a range of foreign-made products .  Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, currently set at 50%, are hitting almost $200 billion worth of steel, aluminum and household items such as fishing reels and brooms . Some officials believe the 232 levies could effectively supplant the country-by-country duties that have drawn legal scrutiny .  The Commerce Department announced last week that 50% duties on steel and aluminum products would be expanded to cover home appliances including dishwashers, dryers and washing machines . Trump said pharmaceutical tariffs will be coming “very soon” and they will encourage companies to reshore production .  US companies can petition the administration to add the goods they produce domestically to the 232 tariffs . Included on the list of steel and aluminum tariffs this year are gymnasium equipment, clothes hangers and door thresholds . On chips, for example, the president already promised to hit smartphones made by Apple and other competitors .  Trump’s 232 investigations have had an indirect effect on his wider trade strategy . They have injected uncertainty into negotiations aimed at forging deals to lower the higher tariffs Trump announced in April . Countries have expressed wariness about signing deals while those probes are still pending .  A key question for negotiating countries is whether individual product levies would stack on top of country-based rates . Back in 2018, the main targets were upstream metals like raw aluminum and steel coils . “This time we’ve got a lot of finished consumer goods” such as metal furniture, kitchen knives, and cooking pots and pans .  Producer Price Index of steel cans and tinware products has jumped 8.7% this year . Tin plate — steel sheets coated with protective tin — wasn’t targeted in Trump’s first-term probes, but this time it is .  Mark Cuban has done sports, reality TV and now health care . Mark Cuban is a billionaire businessman who owns a multi-billion dollar healthcare empire .

" A U.S. federal appeals court has tossed out a $300 million jury verdict that found Apple liable for infringing wireless patents held by Optis Wireless Technology . The court flagged a key flaw in how the trial judge bundled all the patents into a single infringement questionstripping Apple of its right to a unanimous jury decision on each individual claim . The case now heads back to Texas for yet another trial covering both infringement and damages .  Last month, a UK court ruled that Apple owes Optis $502 million for violating similar patents .

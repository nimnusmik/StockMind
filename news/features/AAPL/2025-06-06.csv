" Todd Weaver argues companies can indeed do it successfully, and at a similar or only slightly higher cost . Weaver should know: His startup, Purism, is among the few, if not the only business, that assembles smartphones in the U.S. He says his company has managed to make it work and has been profitable for two years .  President Donald Trump recently put U.S. smartphone production in the spotlight as part of his global trade war . Apple has long assembled its iPhones overseas, mainly in China .  Purism has sold just tens of thousands of phones since debuting its first model in 2018 . Its Liberty Phone, manufactured near San Diego, comes with U.S.-made electronics installed on a metal chassis from China . The company also produces tablet computers, laptops, and servers .  Purism’s phones come with kill switches that disconnect their device from cell service, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth . When turned on, the switches sever the electrical circuit to the features they control and make it impossible for hackers to access them . The phones also run on a Linux-based open source operating system .  Purism’s biggest customers are government agencies, many of which require high security, and individual consumers . Customers can pay extra to have their devices shipped with “tamper evident tape” on the packaging, among other options .  Purism’s assembly line is in Carlsbad, Calif., where up to a dozen workers put together devices . The area is home to a pool of skilled labor thanks to the local defense industry and manufacturing for other mobile carriers . Weaver: U.S. is at a huge disadvantage to China when it comes to skilled workers .  Manufacturing in the U.S. also comes with higher labor costs than in China . Training enough people for such a massive undertaking would take years, Weaver said . Purism took several years to develop its domestic supply chain .  One analyst has said iPhones could end up costing $3,500 if made in the U.S., to account for extra costs and hassles . But given enough time, Apple could substantially reduce the cost after developing a new supply chain, finding enough workers and relying on extensive automation .  Trump’s tariffs would be far more effective if phased in over many years, Weaver said . Weaver argues his U.S. manufacturing effort is already paying off and that it will gain momentum over time . The Liberty Phone is Purism's biggest seller .  Purism can be a successful niche player, but the odds of success are lower thanks to the bigger brands . Weaver is trying to raise additional investment after taking in $16 million in funding over the years . Some of that money would go to fixing a shortcoming with his phones .

" Apple's iPhone sales grew by just under 2% last quarter . Tariffs and a fumbled artificial intelligence strategy could further impact its near-term growth prospects . Despite all the negativity surrounding the stock, this is still Apple -- one of the strongest brands in the world .  Apple has pushed back on the release of some of its more advanced AI features until next year . It's a problematic situation given that its rivals already have AI-powered phones available on the market . Another problem is that Apple faces a lot of exposure totariffsas it makes the vast majority of its products in China .  Apple is still around a $3 trillion market cap despite its poor start this year . But with a lower valuation, it's trading at 31 times its trailing earnings, which is only slightly above its five-year average .

" Microsoft first became the world's biggest company based on market cap in September 1998 . It stayed No. 1 for less than 18 months before being dethroned . Nvidia is in the best position to knock Microsoft off its perch with its market cap already topping $3.3 trillion .  Nvidia is poised to be the biggest beneficiary of several artificial intelligence (AI) trends, notably including the rapid adoption of AI agents that can reason . The restrictions on AI chip exports to China will hurt its growth to some extent . I don't think this headwind will keep Nvidia from becoming much larger over the next decade .  The big question hovering over Apple is: What's the next big breakthrough product for the company? I think smart glasses just might be the much-anticipated next huge hit for Apple . Rumors are circulating that the company plans to launch its first AI-enhanced glasses as early as late 2026 .  Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be able to hold on to its leadership in the cloud services market more strongly than I anticipated in the past . Without OpenAI's ChatGPT, I don't believe Microsoft would claim the largest market cap today . Another reason why I'm more optimistic about Amazon now is that it might be able launch smart glasses that become nearly as must-have as the iPhone years ago .  Amazon must grow significantly faster than Microsoft over the next 10 years for its market cap to become larger . Its AI initiatives are impressive, including the development of its own AI chips .

With Warren Buffett close to retiring, companies similar to Berkshire Hathaway are drawing new interest .

Credit that to the fact that PepsiCo owns most of its production facilities, whereas Coke largely uses third-party bottlers .  Per-share earnings came up short of expectations as well, prompting the company to dial back its full-year profit guidance . New or recently raised tariffs and crimped consumer demand are both factors . The stock's weakness has pumped up its forward-looking dividend yield to 4.3% versus Coke's 2.8% .  Apple is down more than 20% from its late-2024 high and is still struggling despite the overall market's bounce from its early April low . Apple's recent (and proverbially late to the party) artificial intelligence efforts not resonated with consumers nearly as much as hoped .

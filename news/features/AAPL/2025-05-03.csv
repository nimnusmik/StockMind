However, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change, we estimate the . impact to add $900 million to our costs .  Our March quarter revenue of $95.4 billion, was up 5% year over year despite a headwind of almost 2.5 percentage points from foreign exchange . We also grew in the majority of the markets we track .

For China, there was an additional 125% tariff for imports of certain categories of products announced in April . And for us, that's some of our US AppleCare and Accessories businesses .  Tim Cook: We're assuming that the current global tariff, rates, policies, and applications don't change for the balance of the quarter, to be $900 million to our costs . I wouldn't want to predict the mix of production in the future, but I wanted to give you clarity for the June quarter of where the country of origins are .  The March quarter, we don't believe that we saw obvious evidence of a significant pull forward in demand in the March quarter due to tariffs .

We're not sure what will happen with the tariffs, and there is the Section 232 investigation going on .  Timothy Cook: We were down 2%, as you point out, for the March quarter . We were roughly flat when you remove the headwinds from foreign exchange . We did see quite a bit of sequential improvement from the December quarter, which was down 11% .  iPhone was the key driver of the improvement sequentially sequentially . Mac, the iPad, and the Watch are attracting a majority of customers new to that product .  Product gross margins were down sequentially sequentially on seasonal factors but there was a year-over-year decline as well . Kevan Parekh said that the operational team has done an incredible job around optimizing the supply chain and inventory .  Product gross margin was down 340 basis points sequentially sequentially and 70 basis points year-on-year . That was driven by mix, seasonal loss of leverage, foreign exchange, and that was partly offset by cost savings .  As I think about the June quarter guide of low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, I was wondering, do you folks expect Services growth to remain in the double-digit range? I imagine FX is a bit of a benefit as you go to the back half of the year .  Tim or Kevan, how should investors think about the gross margin trajectory as you source more from the US in particular or other supply chain changes that you are making, including in India? How should those kind of into the cost structure? And I have a follow-up question .  Every product cycle is different, and over the years, we have managed gross margin well . We've made good decisions on balancing units' revenue margins . When we launch new products, they tend to have a higher cost structure than the products they replace as we introduce new features and technologies .  The Digital Markets Act has been enacted for a bit over a year, and there's been alternate app stores for some period of time of that . At this point, in Europe, there are some embedded in the actuals. I don't want to predict beyond the current quarter .

I'm just curious if you continue to see that play out similarly in sort of the more broader number of countries you've rolled that out . Or the delays that you talked about related to Siri, personalized Siri features, has that had an impact in terms of consumer willingness to upgrade?  Tim Cook: ""I'm not an economist and so I'd start by saying that. In terms of the -- as you can see from a total company point of view, our results accelerated sequentially to the 5% level""  $500 billion US investment would be helpful . Krish Sankar: How much is CapEx versus R&D? How much of that investment is going into like the Texas server? And then I had a follow-up .  Tim Cook: We're shipping an LLM on the iPhone 16 today .

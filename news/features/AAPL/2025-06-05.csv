" U.S. President Donald Trump has turned his attention to undermining what may well be the greatest corporate success in global history . In a May 23postTrump issued this threat: “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built . If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25 per cent must be paid by Apple .  Why would Trump want to punish an American corporate hero? One reason is Trump’s “America First” theory, the belief that products sold in America should be made in America . Another reason popular among Trump supporters is the idea that production of iPhones and thousands of other goods has been unjustly stolen by the Communist Party dictatorship in China .  Patrick McGee's book outlines how Apple’s adoption of China as its iPhone manufacturing base has led to the transformation of corporate strategies around the globe .  Apple told Vanity Fair that the book is “untrue” and “full of inaccuracies,” none of which the corporation identified . China is the only nation on the planet that could have provided the low-cost manpower at plants that today annually produce more than 230 million iPhones .  The phone maker initially shifted to China with Washington’s endorsement back in 2000 . McGee: China is not a model democracy grounded in economic and individual freedom, but nor is a backward developing dictatorship that destroys growth and opportunity .  Averagewages in the country have doubled over the past decade alone, while GDP per capitahas quadrupled . And it is not impossible that China, in the future, could evolve into a more market-driven individualist society .  Trump’s campaign to bring iPhone manufacturing home to the U.S. comes with political and moral authority . Without China there would be no iPhone and no Apple . Apple has already moved some iPhone production to India, a democratic regime, although one also willing to subsidize Apple .  and create major risks for one of America’s greatest capitalist successes .

" U.S. President Donald Trump has turned his attention to undermining what may well be the greatest corporate success in global history . In a May 23postTrump issued this threat: “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built . If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25 per cent must be paid by Apple .  Why would Trump want to punish an American corporate hero? One reason is Trump’s “America First” theory, the belief that products sold in America should be made in America . Another reason popular among Trump supporters is the idea that production of iPhones and thousands of other goods has been unjustly stolen by the Communist Party dictatorship in China .  Patrick McGee's book outlines how Apple’s adoption of China as its iPhone manufacturing base has led to the transformation of corporate strategies around the globe .  Apple told Vanity Fair that the book is “untrue” and “full of inaccuracies,” none of which the corporation identified . China is the only nation on the planet that could have provided the low-cost manpower at plants that today annually produce more than 230 million iPhones .  The phone maker initially shifted to China with Washington’s endorsement back in 2000 . McGee: China is not a model democracy grounded in economic and individual freedom, but nor is a backward developing dictatorship that destroys growth and opportunity .  Averagewages in the country have doubled over the past decade alone, while GDP per capitahas quadrupled . And it is not impossible that China, in the future, could evolve into a more market-driven individualist society .  Trump’s campaign to bring iPhone manufacturing home to the U.S. comes with political and moral authority . Without China there would be no iPhone and no Apple . Apple has already moved some iPhone production to India, a democratic regime, although one also willing to subsidize Apple .  and create major risks for one of America’s greatest capitalist successes .

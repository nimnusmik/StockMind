Nasdaq President Nelson Griggs said the exchange operator has discussed making public markets more attractive with regulators in Washington . ""We need to make the public markets attractive because that is really how you democratize access to these companies,"" he said .  The SEC said it is looking to ease rules that can impede capital formation . The SEC did not comment on specific discussions it has held with exchanges and other stakeholders . Relaxing rules around disclosure requirements often come at the expense of investors .  The discussions zero in on regulations that make it harder for companies to list and then stay public . One area in focus is an overhaul of current proxy processes, which involves information that companies have to provide shareholders to allow them to vote on various matters . Reform would make it easier for activist shareholders with small stakes to launch proxy contests .  Rollbacks would also make it easier for public companies to raise capital by selling additional shares through follow-on offerings, sources said .

Even at its peak, BlackBerry was nowhere near the financial strength that Apple is at today . Apple reported a staggering $93.7 billion in profit during its most recent fiscal year, with its revenue topping $391 billion .  Apple is no BlackBerry, and it's not in danger of going down a similar path anytime soon . If iPhones fall too far behind the competition, many consumers may eventually become frustrated enough . Apple's brand remains strong and while a delayed AI rollout won't cripple the business, the company does need to do a better job of innovating .  At more than 31 times its trailing earning, the stock is still looking a bit expensive given the challenges ahead and its recent performance . At such a valuation, there isn't enough margin of safety for me to consider buying the stock . I'd suggest keeping the stock on a watch list for now .

" The year 2025, so far, hasn’t been kind to Apple (AAPL) shareholders . The stock is trading below the $200 mark, about 25% off its all-time highs . This is a sharp contrast to the 22% total annualized returns Apple has delivered to shareholders over the past decade .  Apple's recent performance reflects that markets view the company’s thesis as one of the most fragile, mainly due to growing concerns around the ongoing trade war . The possibility of new tariffs on imported products resurfaced after the U.S. president threatened to impose a 25%tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the US . Growth estimates are likely to be revised downward for the coming quarters—and possibly even years .  Approximately 75% of Apple’s revenue still comes from hardware, which is more susceptible to tariff risks . Apple responded quickly by expanding its production outside of China, significantly reducing its reliance on the country . Apple's services segment accounts for around 40% of operating profit .  Currently, Apple trades at 27.3x forward earnings, which is significantly below the 36x peak reached in January . Apple shouldn’t be trading at cheap multiples and probably never will, simply because it’s a company with a historically low risk of underperformance . Apple has faced similar headwinds not long ago and managed to navigate them successfully .  The old saying “buy low, sell high” is somewhat of a misnomer, mainly because no one actually knows where “low” and “high” truly are . Great stocks tend to perform better on a risk-adjusted basis when they’re trending higher .  High-quality stocks are in a clear uptrend when they trade above long-term moving averages like the 200-day moving average . AAPL is right now: stuck in a weak momentum phase . The consensus among AAPL analysts remains mostly bullish, with 16 of 29 experts covering the stock .  Apple bulls may be tempted to jump in on the “buy the dip” opportunity as valuations fall from their peaks . No one ever truly knows how low Apple’s valuation can go . Historically, high-quality stocks tend to behave better when they’re near a peak rather than stuck in the middle of corrections .",negative,"apple, iphones, tariffs, tariff, aapl"

""We need to make the public markets attractive because that is really how you democratize access to these companies,"" he said .

One area in focus is an overhaul of current proxy processes, which involves information that companies have to provide shareholders to allow them to vote on various matters . Reform would make it easier for activist shareholders with small stakes to launch proxy contests .  Rollbacks would also make it easier for public companies to raise capital by selling additional shares through follow-on offerings, sources said .

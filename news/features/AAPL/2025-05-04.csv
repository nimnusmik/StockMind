" Apple's revenue increased 5% year over year in its fiscal Q2 to $95.4 billion . The company's earnings per share jumped 8% to $1.65 . Both top- and bottom-line numbers beat Wall Street's estimates . There's significant uncertainty for Apple related to tariffs beyond its next quarter .  Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company ""had a limited impact from tariffs"" in fiscal Q2 . The company projects that its tariff-related costs will increase by around $900 million in Q3 . One reason why Apple's expected fiscal Q3 impact isn't too bad is that it has built up inventory .  Apple expects that India will be the country of origin for the majority of iPhones that it sells in the U.S. during fiscal Q3 . Nearly all AirPods, Apple Watches, iPads, and Mac products will come from Vietnam . Apple has manufacturing purchase obligations of $38.4 billion as of March 29, 2025 .  The U.S. Commerce Department has launched a Section 232 investigation into the effects of tariffs on semiconductors . The investigation is being used to assess the impact of imports on national security . President Trump's tariffs announced in February 2025 on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act .  The word ""uncertainty"" was mentioned several times during Apple's call . Apple executives were careful to frame the discussion about the future by emphasizing that the company's outlook assumes that the global macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen .

" With these reports, we now have Q1 results from 6 members of the ‘Magnificent 7’ group . The aggregate growth numbers for the group are impressive, but there is a considerable variance among the Mag 7 players . The companies are sticking with their capex plans, which has remained a sticking point with market participants in recent quarters .  Revenues in the cloud business (Amazon Web Services) were up +16.9% to $29.3 billion, just a hair below consensus estimates . The deceleration in Amazon’s cloud revenues was expected and also in line with what we had seen from Alphabet .  Amazon’s modestly lowered Q2 earnings guidance wasn’t tariffs-related, but rather a function of the timing of certain operating expenses . Apple had the most pronounced tariff impact, with June quarter gross margins impacted by about 100 basis points .  Apple’s underperformance has more to do with its China exposure than anything else . The company has good plans in place to shift iPhone assembly to India, particularly for shipments to the U.S. market . Apple is not only faced with regular competitive pressures from local rivals, but also has to contend with its status as an American consumer brand .  Estimates for the Mag 7 group have started coming under pressure lately after remaining very strong over the last two years . The better-than-expected Q1 earnings results have helped reverse this negative trend, at least for now . The group is on track to bring in 23.9% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2025 .  Over 1300 companies on deck to report results this coming week, including 94 S&P 500 members . Ford, Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Uber, DoorDash, and many others reporting this week . Total earnings for these 358 index members are up +13.4% from the same period last year on +4.3% revenue gains .  Q1 EPS beats percentage of 72.6% for the companies that have reported already comparing to the average for the same group of 78.8% over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years) Q1 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 358 S&P 500 members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, the expectation is that earnings will be up +11.6%. That would follow the +14.1% earnings growth on +5.7% revenue gains in the preceding period .  Estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been coming down, with the negative revisions trend expected to accelerate further . Depending on where the emerging tariff regime settles, earnings estimates will need to come down in response . The ongoing market weakness is essentially a reflection of these diminished earnings expectations .  Sectors suffering the biggest cuts to estimates since mid-February include Transportation, Energy, Autos, Basic Materials, Tech, Finance, and others . Aerospace and Construction are the only sectors enjoying modest positive revisions .  Zacksacksacks. (Zacks) was last week's top 10 best-ranked stock market for the year .

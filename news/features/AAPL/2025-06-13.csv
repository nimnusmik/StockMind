" Apple has set an internal release target of spring 2026 for its delayed upgrade of Siri . The Siri team is aiming to bring the revamped voice assistant to market as part of an iOS 26.4 software update . The long-promised changes will allow Siri to tap into consumers’ personal data and on-screen activities .  Apple hasn’t announced exact timing for the new Siri features, people say . The upgrade has been a long time coming . The idea was to modernize the voice assistant, first introduced in 2011 .  Apple has gone nearly two years between announcing the new Siri and delivering it to customers . It's been an especially high-profile delay because the capabilities were part of the iPhone 16 marketing last year . Internally, Apple’s AI and marketing teams have pointed fingers at each other .  Apple has been pushing Siri features for iOS 18.4 and iOS 8.5 . The company had been expected to be released in fall of 2024 and spring of 2025 . The delays stemmed from engineering snags that kept Siri from working properly a third of the time .  Giannandrea kept a low profile at Apple's latest developer event this week . He's also less influential internally, according to people with knowledge of the matter . Engineering for Siri was taken over by Vision Pro headset creator Mike Rockwell and software engineering chief Craig Federighi .  Apple announced a sweeping design overhaul for all of its platforms this week . It didn't introduce major in-house AI features beyond opening its large language models to developers and adding live translation to calls and text messages . It also didn’t introduce or demonstrate Siri features, though Federighi did address the delay .  Apple has been working on an even more ambitious Siri revamp . This would turn the assistant into an always-on device copilot that’s more conversational . Apple also has teams exploring a chatbot-like app dubbed Knowledge that can tap into the open web .  The CEO was removed from his responsibilities during the shake-up earlier this year . That has spurred concerns within the company over whether his team is up to the latest challenge .",neutral,"siri, ios, iphone, voice, apple"

Apple announced a $100 billion buyback at the start of May after reporting fiscal second-quarter revenue and earnings surpassing analysts’ expectations . Apple’s stock price is down over 3% since announcing the buyback and down 19% year-to-date .  Apple CEO Tim Cook admitted to owning cryptocurrenciessuch as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2021 . But Cook said he wouldn't invest in crypto because he doesn't think people buy Apple stock to get exposure to crypto, he said .

This technology automatically translates text or spoken words into the user’s preferred language in real time . During FaceTime calls, users will see live captions, whereas for phone calls, Apple will translate the conversation aloud .  Apple also introduced a new feature that allows users to create polls within the Messages app . Spotlight, the on-device search feature for Mac, will now incorporate Apple Intelligence to improve its contextual awareness .  The most disappointing news to emerge from the event was that the much-anticipated developments for Siri aren’t ready yet . Attendees were eager for a glimpse of the promised AI-powered features that were expected to debut . This delay may raise questions about Apple’s strategy for the voice assistant .",neutral,"ios, facetime, apple, ai, features"

" Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino and an unnamed European journalist were hacked using spyware made by Israeli surveillance tech provider Paragon . Until now, there had been no evidence that the journalist had been targeted or hacked with spyware .  The Citizen Lab’s new report puts into question the conclusions of a parliamentary committee investigating the use of spyware by the Italian government . The new revelations come months after WhatsApp first notified around 90 of its users that they had been targeted with Paragon spyware .  Ciro Pellegrino told TechCrunch that he believes that his civil rights have been “trampled upon” The Citizen Lab believes that the Italian government is in a position to definitively answer questions about what was done with their use of Paragon spyware .  The fact that both Cancellato and Pellegrino work for the same outlet suggests they may be part of a “cluster” of targets, according to Citizen Lab report . The Italian government published a press releasedenying it was behind the targeting of any journalist or human rights activists . “It is possible that someone was hoping to gain information,” says one Fanpage reporter .  A spokesperson for COPASIR referred TechCrunch to the report it published last week . The Italian government did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment . Another journalist, Monica Macchioni, said in early May that she had received a notification from Apple .  The Citizen Lab said the journalist was hacked with “a sophisticated zero-click attack against the device via iMessage,” based on the researchers finding a specific iMessage account “present in the device logs around the same time as the phone was communicating with the Paragon server” The lab’s researchers analyzed the unnamed journalist's devices and found one of them was infected with Graphite .  The Citizen Lab said it found the same iMessage account on the victim's iPhone’s logs . Apple did not comment on the report . Paragon and its Italian intelligence customers suspended the company's Italian customers .  The Citizen Lab has not attributed Pellegrino’s and the other unnamed European journalists’ hacks to any government . Two other people have so far been confirmed to have been targeted with Paragon's spyware: Luca Casariniand Beppe Caccia .  David Yambio, a Sudanese citizen and president and co-founder ofRefugees in Libya, received a notification from Apple . The Citizen Lab said it found traces of a spyware infection, but could not link the compromise to a particular spyware maker nor any government . COPASIR, however, said it was lawfully targeted by Italian intelligence agencies, but not Graphite .  Citizen Lab forensic and technical analyses are ongoing on all cases, including Cancellato .

" Donald Trump hailed the outcome of trade talks in London, Xi Jinping walked away with an understated strategic gain . Trump declared Wednesday on social media that a deal had been “DONE” to restore the flow of critical magnets from China . Hours earlier, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revealed Washington would unwind its recent tech curbs, if niche metals now flowed fast enough .  Beijing’s most substantial comments so far on the talks made no mention of export controls . Instead, the Communist Party mouthpiece touted an “institutional guarantee” established in Geneva for the two sides to bridge differences via a “consultation mechanism” Xi favors a framework led by his lieutenants that wards against being blindsided .  China's lack of term limits presents very different incentives than for Trump, says Gavekal Research. China's slow-walking negotiations allows China to assess how hard a bargain Trump drives .  The lack of a detailed read out from either side this time around has left much in doubt . Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong pledged his country would “fully consider the reasonable needs and concerns of all countries in the civilian sector .  Trump declared on social media that China now faces a 55% charge, a number that appears to include levies introduced during his first presidency . Lutnick cast doubt on the nature of future negotiations, saying that tariffs on China would “definitely” stick at their current level .  President Trump faces a self-imposed July 9 deadline to either strike pacts with dozens of global trading partners or reimpose sweeping tariffs . He warned Wednesday that he will soon send letters to countries saying, “this is the deal, you can take it or leave it” Exemplifying that willingness to keep things moving, Trump’s team in a rare move this week put export controls on the table .  Rebalancing their economies could involve attracting more Chinese investment into the US . Policy whiplash by the Trump administration might deter many Chinese companies from pouring money into the U.S. areas where Beijing is looking to build self sufficiency and nurture its own national champions .

The economic advisory firm's Global Cities Index scored the 1,000 largest cities across five categories: economics, human capital, quality of life, environment and governance . The significance of cities in this period of uncertainty can't be overstated .  French capital of Paris took over in third place this year from US city of San Jose, which fell to fourth spot . San Jose is renowned for the tech hub of Silicon Valley, which is home to big-name companies, including Apple and Google .  The US city of Seattle, which rounded out the top five, also boasts a major sector – with Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) operating in the area . The Australian cities of Melbourne and Sydney came in sixth and seventh place .  Several cities in India, Indonesia, and the UK have risen in the rankings this year, while Japanese, Canadian, and Brazilian cities mostly fell .

" President Cyril Ramaphosa came to the White House looking to persuade President Donald Trump to stop floating the conspiracy theory that there's a genocide against White people in South Africa . Trump asked that the lights be dimmed and teed up a video that purported to back up his claims that there was Afrikaner farmer genocide . He had sought the meeting in a bid to build a relationship with the president and boost trade .  The episode confirmed the fears of some of Ramaphosa’s advisers who had warned he was being lured into an Oval Office encounter similar to the one that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy experienced earlier this year . It was “definitely an ambush, because the program format was changed at the last minute,” a spokesman says .  The rand weakened as the discussion between Trump and Ramaphosa became more heated . It traded 0.1% lower at 17.9450 per dollar by 8:25 p.m. in Johannesburg . The income of White families is on average almost five times as much as Black families .  There were multiple signs that Trump and his team had this welcome in mind for Ramaphosa . At the last minute, the administration changed the program to put the leaders in front of press cameras instead of first having a private meeting . No land has been seized by the state since apartheid ended .  The head of Afriforum, the fringe Afrikaner group that lobbied the first Trump administration, said the video was similar to some of their own content . “I think it was important,” he added, because it put issues like ‘property rights and infringement of human rights through racial measures and also this ‘Kill the Boer’ question on the table .  Ramaphosa kept his cool and didn't push back too hard on Trump . Zelenskiy called for a reset in ties between the two countries and to advance trade . He stressed the necessity for the countries to work together .  Ramaphosa: ""There is just no genocide in South Africa"" Trump has objected to a land bill that will make it easier for the government to expropriate private property . The law allows for expropriation without compensation in certain cases such as land abandoned and abandoned .  Ramaphosa sought to explain the law and it's relationship to the country’s apartheid era . Trump froze almost all aid to Pretoria in February, claiming it persecuted White Afrikaner farmers and took “aggressive positions” toward the US .

" OpenAI will acquire the AI device startup co-founded by Apple veteran Jony Ive and Sam Altman, called “io,” for nearly $6.5 billion . This almost certainly will put OpenAI in the consumer hardware business .  ChatGPT was released in 2022 and is now used by more than 400 million people around the world . Gartner analyst Chirag Dekate says chatbot set the bar for what early experiences of generative AI ought to look like .  OpenAI will get an opportunity to define the ideal software-hardware fusion for the new computing paradigm it helped usher in . Apple has struggled to empower its devices with new generative AI capabilities, and may require a fundamentally different UX .  Google looks like a company that’s got its mojo back . The company’stwo-hour keynoteat its developer event in Mountain View Tuesday was all about AI . Google seems to have fully woken up to the AI revolution it helped start, and seems to be navigating it with level-headedness .  Google entered the AI race only reluctantly in 2023, in the wake of the ChatGPT launch . The company was, for legal and safety reasons,deeply conflicted about exposing such models to the public . After OpenAI, Microsoft, and others hurried to apply and commercialize LLMs, Google found itself on the back foot .  Features from the company’sProject Astrawork will increasingly let the AI gather information about objects (or problems) it sees (through a phone camera or smart glasses) in the real world around the user .

" Sir Jony Ive is making aremarkable return to Silicon Valley’s bleeding edge with a new collaborator– Sam Altman . The Essex-born design expert will work with OpenAI and its founder Altman to develop a new range of consumer gadgets that can augment, and perhaps one day replace, the iPhone he helped make inescapable .  New partners plan to “completely reimagine what it means to use a computer’, Altman says . Details are scarce on what their products will ultimately look like . Altman told staff he and Ive intended to build millions of artificial intelligence ‘companions’  Ive was widely viewed as the second most important executive at Apple . After Jobs’s death, some saw him as the most important . His design consultancy, LoveFrom, has since worked with clients including Ferrari, and on the King's Coronation . His latter years at Apple reportedly left the designer burnt out and increasingly disillusioned with the behemoth's culture .  Ive criticised Silicon Valley’s ‘corporate agendas’ of ‘money and power’ in Silicon Valley . He said Silicon Valley had replaced a more idealistic goal of “trying to move things forward ... creating something better”  OpenAI hopes to sell 100m AI devices that can work alongside a laptop or smartphone . The first gadget could be a small ‘pod’ likely to augment, rather than replace, the iPhone . Other smart gadgets could ultimately follow, with Altman promising a ‘family of devices”  OpenAI has never launched a piece of hardware . Humane, a start-up founded by ex-Apple engineers, tried and failed to sell an AI “pin” The Rabbit r1, a similar pocket-sized AI puck, was met with dismal reviews .

Jony Ive will design the defining way of using what Silicon Valley believes is the next great technology to sweep the world .

" The fringe group that planted the seed for some of Donald Trump’s false claims that South Africa is persecuting White farmers saw years of lobbying US politicians pay off . Trump lambasted his South African counterpart, Cyril Ramaphosa, in what the foreign delegation called a “well-orchestrated, well-planned” ambush .  The word boer is Afrikaans for farmer, and historically refers to “White man” in the context of the struggle against apartheid . The phrase has been chanted by leaders including Julius Malema, head of the Economic Freedom Fighters party, at political rallies .  White crosses were temporarily erected to protest farm murders, a race relations expert says . The crosses were erected in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province in 2020, archives of Afrikaans news outlet Maroela Media show . The income of White families is on average almost five times higher than that of their Black counterparts, statistics show .  More than 27,000 people are murdered annually in South Africa, with a disproportionate number of the victims being young men in low-income areas such as predominantly Black townships . The killing of farmers has been declining over the past 20 years . No land has been seized by the state since apartheid ended .  Afriforum expressed confidence that he would see Trump at a Group of 20 summit in Johannesburg in November . Trump didn’t commit to showing up at that summit .

Trump said he “had a little problem with Tim Cook,” and asked Apple’s chief executive officer to stop building plants in India . Political risk has been a driver of markets overall this year .  Apple's fate has been closely tied to the trade war and it has avoided the worst-case scenario that seemed plausible last month . While shares saw incredible tariff-related volatility, the stock is still up 16% from the low it hit after the tariffs were first announced in early April .  Resolving Trump's concerns around Apple’s foreign manufacturing may be tricky, given the near-impossibility of building iPhones and other hardware in the US, especially in the short term . But the ire targeted at Apple is only one of the geopolitical risks that the company is facing from Trump's policies . Financial results released earlier this month reinforced concerns about a slowdown in the China market .  Apple trades at 26.6 times estimated earnings, well above its 10-year average of 21.6 .

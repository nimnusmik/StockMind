Visa and American Express benefit from network effects that help them steadily grow over time .  Apple assembles the vast majority of key products, like iPhones, in China . President Trump has cast Apple onto the front lines of the trade war with China, with the latest decision being a 25% tariff on iPhones not made in the U.S.  Apple may just have to absorb the tariff hit and hope resolutions come soon or pass along a portion of the costs to consumers . The good news is that Apple has highly anticipated products with AI features coming this fall which may be enough to pique consumer interest and justify higher price tags .

American Express is so profitable that it converts around two-thirds of every dollar in sales into operating income . Visa's expenses mainly go toward maintaining its network, American Express spends more on card member rewards than on operating expenses . American Express attracts affluent customers due to the high annual fees on its cards .  Apple, Microsoft, Visa, and American Express have seen their stock prices grow rapidly .

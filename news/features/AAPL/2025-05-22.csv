" China's top search engine had made early advances in AI but fell behind as DeepSeek shocked the world with its low-cost model . Baidu’s shares are up 6% in Hong Kong this year, while Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has surged 48% and the Hang Seng Tech Index has climbed 19% .  China tech stocks have lost some steam since March’s DeepSeek-fueled peak . Recent earnings from Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. underwhelmed investors looking for a new catalyst . Advertising still accounts for the bulk of Baidu's revenue .  Analysts expect Baidu to post robust cloud sales growth of more than 20% for the three months ended March .

" Apple is a shining example of what happens when you combine American ingenuity and a passion for excellence . Kroger only serves U.S. consumers, but isn’t nearly is reliant on imported goods as you might expect . Warren Buffett remains a big fan of this country and the opportunities it still offers .  The Coca-Cola Company's name, colors, and logo are prominently featured on everything from Christmas ornaments to clothing to home décor . This phenomenon doesn't exist nearly as deeply for any other beverage brand .  The vast majority of Coca-Cola's products are bottled and distributed by authorized partners in or near the same countries where they're ultimately consumed . The company's chief cost of doing international business is actually the taxes owed when it repatriates profits generated overseas . North America is its single-biggest and most important market in terms of profits .  Apple's iPhone is by far America's favorite smartphone, accounting for roughly half of all smartphone sales . The forward-looking dividend yield of 2.8% isn't exactly thrilling either, but it's also a reliable grower, having now been raised for 63 consecutive years .  Apple isn't a U.S. company, but it's not even predominantly an American company . The vast majority of the world's iPhones are made in China, with roughly one-third of them being sold in the United States . Apple can and will shift at least some of this production to India, which would sidestep the most volatile front of the ongoing tariff war . Still, this impending shift in production dramatically dials back the American identity .  At 300 million shares collectively worth $64 billion, Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's single-biggest holding . The Kroger Company is arguably one of Berkshire's least-talked-about holdings . At 50 million shares, this $3.4 billion position only makes up about 1% of the entire value .  Kroger shares have been strangely resilient of late, continuing to march deeper into new-record-high territory . The Cincinnati-based company's 2,731 supermarkets are only found in the U.S. Kroger still procures bread and cereal from Canada and a variety of fruits and vegetables from Mexico .  Kroger has ""really, really small, single-digit exposure"" to imports from China . CFO Todd Foley: ""It's not a massive impact"" Kroger is never going to be a high-growth ticker, but it's a fantastic choice .

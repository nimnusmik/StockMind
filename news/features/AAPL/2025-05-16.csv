" The Justice Department’s principal antitrust division deputy, Roger Alford, said the new administration is going to aggressively pursue illegal competition . The approach is already evident in a number of antitrust enforcement cases targeting Big Tech companies .  The FTC is also asking for D.C. federal district court judge James Boasbergin a separate antitrust trial to force Meta (META) to sell off Instagram as well as WhatsApp . Many of these cases started during the first Trump administration, where Alford also worked .  The DOJ is also working to prevent harmful monopoly conduct before it happens, Alford said . One way is by adopting more flexible merger review standards . Consent decrees with merging parties that put antitrust concerns at bay .

Alford added that the administration's philosophy is that it can best promote US competition and innovation by focusing on unfair competition in industries that the public cares about .

Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers dramatically escalated the ongoing legal battle between Apple and Epic Games .  Judge Rogers ruled Apple's response to the injunction as deliberately anticompetitive . Apple had secretly imposed a 27% fee on transactions conducted through external links, barely lower than their usual commission . Rogers referred both Apple and Alex Roman to federal prosecutors for potential criminal contempt charges .  Apple filed an emergency appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court, arguing that compliance with the injunction would cause significant financial harm . Apple claimed that allowing unrestricted external payment methods could cost the company billions in annual revenue, severely undermining its App Store business model . Judge Rogers refused to delay enforcing her order, emphasizing Apple’s repeated delays and clear non-compliance . Legal analysts predict that Apple faces significant hurdles in its appeal due to the abundance of evidence presented against it .  Epic Games submitted Fortnite for review, aiming to resume availability on iPhones and iPads . Apple's compliance remains uncertain, as the injunction does not explicitly force Apple to restore Epic’s developer account or immediately approve the fan-favorite game .

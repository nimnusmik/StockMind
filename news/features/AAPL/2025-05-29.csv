MercadoLibrefounder and CEO Marcos Galperin stepping down . HowHome DepotandLowe'sare holding up until macro tailwinds return . Two stocks worth watching: Warby ParkerandPDD Holdings .  The Motley Fool's total average return is 957% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to167% for the S&P 500 . Consider when Netflixmade this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $639,271!  Open AI will be buying IO a device start-up led by famedAppledesigner Jony Ive . Jony and Jason Ive have apparently been in talks for a while . We've been thinking about AI generally in a software sense .  Open AI has the potential to be a threat to Apple given its apparent lack of progress in the AI space to date . Bill Mann: Building compelling devices that ultimately do something different than what we're used to doing today and then actually changing consumer behavior is really hard .  Some in the financial media are likening this toMetathen Facebook buying Instagram for $1 billion back when it was a 13 person company . At the end of the day, we're going to have to be a little patient with this IO development .  Jony Ive is probably the first person you'd want to be doing this, Bill Mann says . Jason Moser: We ultimately have no clue what they're thinking about, and it sounds like maybe they're still in that development stage .  MercadoLibre dropped earnings earlier this month . They weren't quite done with updates. The MercoLibre CEO says that has never happened before in consumer hardware .  Mercado Libre founder and CEO Marcos Galperin will step down from his leadership role . Irina, a listener from the Czech Republic, wrote us a note immediately after the news came out . Bill Mann: It sounds like the essence of how a transition should be conducted .  Howard Schultz left Starbucks at what you would think was the top, and it turned out to be at the top . Ariel Sharstin, the president of commerce, will be stepping into the role . Jason Moser: ""It seems like about as good an executive position as you could line up""  Mercado Libre, not necessarily a household name for a lot of folks who follow the US market . But zooming in on Gubern's tenure, he launched the company, co founder, took the company public, shares up roughly 9,000% .  When Mercado Libre launched, it was meant to be, and was described as the eBay of Latin America . Now it's so far beyond that. It became theAmazonof Latin America, which is not an easy place to build a business like this. e-commerce business now does hundreds of billions in total payment volume.  Sook Bum Kim still owns nearly a 9% stake in the company worth north of $4 billion . He controls close to 75% of total voting power there, according to the latest proxy that was just filed in April . Dylan Lewis: Bill Mann is the king of obscure stocks .  This is a bonus radar stock segment this show . We've got a lot more coming up later, in fact, the dollars and data on home improvement . Stay right here.  Target has completely lost its way and as we've seen in retail, if you are a retailer who has a little bit of fire in your brand, you're doing fine . 75% of Walmart's market share gains came from households that make $100,000 .  Home Depot had 60% exposure to China in 2017 . Today, that's about 30% and they feel that it will be under 25% by the end of next year . It seems like they're making progress on the digital front and then everything is going back to tariffs and how exposed these retailers are .  Bill Mann: Big ticket purchases, those $1,000 or more, that was actually up three tenths of a percentage point from a year ago . Mann: Comp average ticket was essentially flat and transactions only decreased about half a percent . The fact that they maintained guidance for the full year was a positive .  Some of that has to do with things being pulled forward because of COVID when we were sitting in our houses during the pandemic, staring at things that needed to be done . Also the higher rate environment eating into some home improvement projects that people might be financing .  Lowe's announced in April that they're acquiring artisan design group, say business focused on design, services, looking at flooring, cabinets, countertops . Dylan Lewis: It seems like they're integrating it nicely and it will absolutely just expand that network .  Both Home Depot and Home Depot are very smart retailers, Bill Mann says . Both recognize that the game for both of them is to make sure that they don't get disintermediated by somebody else rather than each other .  Home Depot is significantly larger in market cap, store footprint, and whatnot . Over the last five years, Lowe's has been the outperformer . But it was something that struck me when Marvin Ellison took over the CEO role at Lowe's, one of the main priorities was taking that cash cow business and returning some value to shareholders .  Home Depot's share repurchases brought that share account down about 8% . Lowe's, that share accounts down like 26% over the same time period . That whittles down that overall pie of shares outstanding making each share a little bit more valuable .  Trex CEO Bryan Fairbanks is the brand name in decking . Fairbanks talks about the company's recycled composite composite products . The company is on Shelves at Home Depot and Lowe's .  Bryan Fairbanks: ""Composite decking"" is a mixture of wood and recycled plastic . ""We have products that range anywhere from two dollars a linear foot to over $10 a . linear foot, depending upon the aesthetics of the product""  Trex has been doing this for over 35 years now. We stick to our knitting. We know what we're doing in the outdoor living area and we're proud of the products that we've put into the market over the years .  The product was picked up by both Lowe's and Home Depot . It's widely available across the country. We're be looking at over 6,000 locations where our product can be serviced .  Trex is primarily repair remodel. 90 to 95% of our business is repair and remodel . Trex has the largest footprint of areas where our product can be purchased .  Trex will be selling products direct into Home Depot and Lowe's stores . Trex also has a side of the business with Builders first source, USBM 84 Lumber . Most of those are going to be catering more to the pro business .  Bryan Fairbanks: About 5% of our total cost of goods sold are going to be potentially impacted by tariffs . Trex is primarily a North American-produced company, he says .  Think about gloves. Think about safety glasses. Virtually all of those are manufactured in Asia somewhere . Even when you are primarily a US manufacturer, we are not going to be immune from these tariffs . We'll start to see the impact on the direct purchasing over the next quarter .  Bryan Fairbanks: ""I'm very comfortable where we are, our ability to be able to mitigate it. Our supply chain team has already done a great job in identifying where they're coming from, being able to negotiate mitigating strategies""  A lot of talk about a potential recession on and off talk, Sanmeet Deo says . How does Trex navigate this potential recession scenario or in housing? Deo: ""We're taking a little bit of a step back and waiting to see where this all settles out""  Repair and remodel has slowed as well as the new home side of things, that's been stable, but we're still below where we need to be from a replacement cycle . Existing home sales continue to lag, but Trex has tended to perform better around recessionary times .  People have been underinvesting in their existing homes since the end of 2022 . By 2024, we hit the projected low spot about $1 per square foot of livable space . On average, that repair and remodel rate should be closer to $1.26 per sq. foot . By 2027, we'll be back to that average again .  Bryan Fairbanks: Trex has been in a trading range now for the better part of a couple years . As we start to see some of these economic metrics come back, we will start to . see a broader expansion of valuations in these companies .  Bryan Fairbanks: ""We have the profitability, we have the growth, and I think the stock will be back off to the races again"" Dylan Lewis: ""I'm more excited because of that pent-up demand. Pretty excited about that"" Jason Moser and Bill Mann join Fairbanks on our Motley Fool 24 member live stream .  Dylan Lewis and Bill Mann discuss the stocks on their radar this week .

" Meta Platforms Inc. has done all it can in court to fight back at the FTC's claims that it's a monopoly . The seven-week trial wrapped up Tuesday and now each side has four months to make its case in writing . Judge James Boasberg will decide whether Meta has an illegal monopoly in the social media market .  If Meta wins outright, the FTC is expected to appeal . Boasberg's ruling will only address whether the company violated the law . If he sides with the FTC, that will trigger another trial over how to address the harm from Meta’s conduct . The FTC maintains that only a full sale of both assets will fix the problem .  The FTC has argued that Meta dominates a narrow segment of the social networking market .

The FTC has shown that friends and family share still exists, but has fallen short in showing that it's still the dominant reason people come to Meta's products .

The company delayed its improved Siri until later this year and is still trying to catch up to competitors . President Trump is now coming for the iPhone .

Building an iPhone in the US would not only require a Herculean effort to pull off during Trump's term but also add hundreds of dollars to iPhone prices .

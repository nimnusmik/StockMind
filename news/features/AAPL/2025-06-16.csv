At WWDC 2025, Apple announced new features across Apple products, allowing developers to access the company's on-device large language model (LLM) Apple also unveiled a software interface update called Liquid Glass and a new operating system for many of its products called iOS 26 .  As of Friday afternoon, Apple was down 3.8% compared to its closing price on June 6 before WWDC began . There is no shortage of criticism that Apple is behind on AI and isn't innovating enough . Apple is in a different position than other companies because it is mainly consumer-facing .  Apple is vulnerable to tariffs, as it assembles most of its products in China . If users like Apple's upgrades, they may be willing to pay a higher price for new products .

" US President Donald Trump wrapped up his tour of the Middle East today, concluding numerous high-profile deals and diplomatic engagements with countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates . Trump inked a massive AI data centre project where the two countries will be partnering on an artificial intelligence campus .  The US and UAE have agreed to deepen cooperation in artificial intelligence . The countries did not specify which AI chips from Nvidia or other companies could be included in the data centres .  Wedbush reiterated the stock as “Outperform” with a $270 price target . The firm said that Apple is doubling down on its production strategy for the iPhone 17, and that its manufacturing will be centered in India and China . Wedbush praised CEO Tim Cook for managing an �precedented supply chain situation .  AAPLranks 5thon our list of trending AI stocks on Wall Street right now .

" Apple investors are likely breathing a sigh of relief, given the amount of manufacturing Apple does in China . The state of Apple stock could negate any benefits from a U.S.-China trade agreement . Apple recently lost its market caplead to Nvidia, which is now just behindMicrosoft's $3.35 trillion capitalization .  Ives is likely right to take a more bullish view on Apple amid the U.S.-China trade talks . The iPhone still made up 53% of the company's revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2025 . Apple claims approximately $157 billion in liquidity, likely giving it more optionality than any public company except for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway .  Ives' bullish call may have overlooked the serious shortcomings that led to Apple losing its market cap lead . The immediate agreement with China is a 90-day pause on tariffs, not an agreement that takes the issue off the table . Investors should likely prepare for this issue to return to the forefront in the coming months .  Revenue in the first two quarters of fiscal 2025 was $220 billion, an increase of 4% . That led to a net income of $61 billion for the same period, 6% higher than year-ago levels . While these are still increases, it shows Apple is no longer the growth name it was in the past .  Investors should probably take Ives' optimism with a grain of salt and refrain from adding shares of Apple stock . A single-digit growth rate on its profits and the loss of its market cap lead are significant signs of the company's maturing . It is also less of an innovator and maintains a relatively high P/E ratio .  The S&P 500's average return is975% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to172%for the S-P 500 .

" Stocks entered the green for the year as investors cheered the US-China trade thaw . The ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks continued theirrenewed ascent . Earnings from economic bellwethers Cisco (CSCO) and Walmart (WMT) didn't completely suck .  Ex-Medtronic CEO Bill George says CEOs should get away from corporate guidance . He says earnings estimates and corporate guidance are useless in a backdrop where one social media post could blow up company's financial planning .  Walmart reiterated its full-year earnings per share forecast on Thursday after ratcheting down expectations at an investor event several weeks ago . Executives went on to say they would start raising prices (by raising prices)  If tariffs go back to pre-thaw levels, it may render guidance obsolete . Yet, the guidance is out there . Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz decided to pull guidance altogether because of trade uncertainty . United Airlines (UAL) still has its double guidance range out there(which numerous execs have privately made fun of). Yet despite all the confusion, we have the Street looking for earnings growth north of 10% this year .  Earnings estimates and guidance have historically proven to be important drivers of stock prices . To the extent they no longer are, I view it as one more problem for investors to contend with in a challenging 2025 .",negative,"earnings, executives, stocks, stock, forecast"
" Warren Buffett has steered the Berkshire Hathaway to market-crushing returns since 1965 . An investment of $1,000 in Berkshire stock in 1965 would have been worth $44.7 million at the end of 2024 . The same investment in theS&P 500 index would have grown to just $342,906 over the same period .  Buffett's brand of long-term investing, which focuses on companies with steady growth, reliable profitability, and strong management teams, is likely to endure . With that said, three existing holdings, which make up 32.9% of Berkshire's $286 billion portfolio, are using AI to supercharge their legacy businesses .  Amazon created its own family of large language models (LLMs) called Nova, which the company claims can save developers up to 75% on costs compared to using other third-party models on the AWS Bedrock platform . Then there is the Amazon Q AI assistant, which is embedded into AWS, which can help businesses analyze their internal data .  Coca-Cola has used AI to create content for interactive marketing campaigns, and even to create a new promotional beverage . In 2024, in 2024, ""everything will be generative AI"" eventually, says Pratik Thakar .  Coca-Cola signed a deal to spend $1.1 billion over five years withMicrosoftAzure to integrate AI into its manufacturing processes, its supply chains, and deeper into its marketing strategies . Buffett and his team spent approximately $38 billion accumulatingApple shares between 2016 and 2023 . That position was worth over $170 billion, accounting for around half of Berkshire's entire portfolio .  Apple has been preparing for the AI revolution for years . The company designs its own chips, and the latest versions for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers were crafted with AI workloads in mind . Apple Intelligence provides users with powerful new writing tools, allowing them to summarize lengthy emails and text messages with a single click .  There are more than 2.35 billion active Apple devices worldwide, so the company could become the biggest distributor of AI to consumers . Berkshire could still earn significant returns from its remaining Apple stake as the company's AI strategy unfolds .

Amazon has a much clearer revenue growth path to help it achieve the hundreds of billions of dollars in annual earnings needed to warrant this valuation .

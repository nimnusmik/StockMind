The defiant tone came despite top administration officials saying earlier Friday that Trump was trying to drive US trading partners to strike better deals .  US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed hope “this would light a fire under the EU. EU” The pivot was a notable change in tone from a G.7 finance ministers’ meeting earlier this week .

Trump indicated that the import levies would be “appropriately done” and ready for implementation by the end of June .  Trump’s demand for US-based manufacturing pose a stark challenge to Apple and Samsung, whose supply chains for their devices have been concentrated in Asia for years . Trump also threatened a 50% tariff on the European Union that would go into effect June 1, which weighed on the broader market .  Trump’s warning on Friday took shape after Apple signaled earlier this month that new tariffs would bring as much as $900 million in higher costs in the current quarter . Apple had already planned to transfer the bulk of its US-bound iPhone production to facilities in India .  Apple said earlier this year that it plans to spend $500 billion in the US over the next four years . Moving manufacturing of its signature iPhone and other devices to the US would be an enormous and expensive undertaking for Cupertino, California-based Apple .  The change threatens to cut Apple’s gross margin by 3 to 3.5 percentage points in fiscal 2026 . But moving iPhone production to the US would likely still be far more costly than paying the tariff .

" Donald Trump has threatened to impose 50 per cent tariffs on the EU from next month .

The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.1pc and Apple lost 2.3pc . Mr Trump has dialled back or paused many of his tariff threats in recent weeks .  The tech giant has a deeply ingrained supply chain in Asia, and that is going to be very difficult for it to extricate itself from . Apple hoped it could get around the worst of the tariffs by shipping iPhone products to the US from India and Vietnam . The US administration has not looked kindly on such tactics and is now threatening new tariffs .

Markets are reacting quickly and anxiously to Donald Trump’s latest social media post . But by saying only that he is “recommending” this 50pc tariff on the EU, has the president left himself some wriggle room? It has been widely reported in recent days that Washington is frustrated with the EU's offer on trade .  Oil prices have dropped following Donald Trump’s threats to hit the EU with 50pc tariffs . Brent crude fell below $64 per barrel, capping off a week of declines that has seen it fall by around 3pc .  The Vix index, Wall Street's fear gauge, spiked to its highest level in two week .

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.3pc, the S&P 500 dropped 1.5pc and the Nasdaq 100 was lower .  Donald Trump’s imposition of a 50pc tariff will do little to convince Brussels that it should be kinder to the US on trade . A handful of EU capitals had already blocked the possibility of offering to unilaterally reduce tariffs on US goods .  The US 30-year bond yield had hit its highest level in 18-months over concerns that the $36 trillion American debt pile was becoming unsustainable . Investors had been looking nervously at bond markets this week as longer-term debt costs ticked higher in the run-up to the passing of the tax-cutting “big beautiful bill” by the House of Representatives .  Donald Trump has also threatened to hit Apple’s iPhones with fresh tariffs . The Republican said he would add import duties of 25pc to any iPhones built overseas . The move could increase the price of the smartphones by hundreds of dollars .  White House officials have repeatedly raised the prospect of a 'Made in America' iPhone . Currently the majority of its phones are built in China by its Taiwanese supplier, Foxconn . But the long-running trade disputes between the US and Beijing have prompted it to shift production elsewhere .  The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has now dropped by more than 1pc in the wake of Donald Trump’s Truth Social post . Traders had favoured just two reductions before the post on Truth Social .

" President Donald Trump demanded Apple and other smartphone makers make their phones in the United States or face a 25% tariff . Trump last week during his Middle East trip said he was displeased with Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, over the plans to manufactureiPhones set to be sold in the US at newly built plants in India .

The South Korea-based tech giant closed its last phone factory in China in 2019 .  Apple CEO Tim Cook met with Trump at the White House on Tuesday, an administration official says . Roughly 90% of Apple’s iPhone production and assembly is based in China . Trump met with Cook in Riyadh at the beginning of his Middle East trip .  Some of Apple’s chips are already made in the United States, thanks to its partnership with TSMC, which recently opened a chipmaking plant in Arizona . Apple has long contended that it cannot manufacture iPhones in America .  Steve Jobs, Apple’s late CEO, famously brought up the issue during an October 2010 meeting with former President Barack Obama . Jobs called America’�s lackluster education system an obstacle for Apple, which needed 30,000 industrial engineers to support its on-site factory workers . In a 2012 interview with tech journalists Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he agreed with Jobs’ assessment .  iPhones could cost more than three times their current price of around $1,000, Ives says . He estimates moving all of Apple’s iPhone production to the United States would take five to 10 years . Even then, it would cost Apple about $30 billion and three years to move just 10% of its supply chain to the US .  Apple is considering raising prices when it releases its new lineup of iPhones in the fall . The company will likely avoid directly attributing the increases to tariffs . Apple announced a $500 billion investment to expand its US facilities earlier this year .  Apple plans to invest in corporate facilities and production of Apple TV+ shows in 20 states . It will also expand data center capacity in several states .",negative,"apple, smartphone, iphone, iphones, manufactureiphones"

Apple didn't respond to a request for comment about the remarks .  Trump has pushed for companies to build and manufacture products in the United States . Shifting production to the U.S. would take years and result in price hikes for consumers . The tariffs are expected to start in June .  In the June quarter, Apple expects to source the majority of iPhones sold in the United States from India . Apple makes most of its iPhones in China, but has expanded production in India, Vietnam and other countries . Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics contract manufacturer that assembles Apple's products, is planning to build a $1.5-billion plant in India .  Tariffs would make it more expensive to repair an iPhone because the smartphone includes parts that come from other countries including China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan . Apple isn't alone in navigating the potential impact of tariffs . Other U.S. companies including Walmart have said they would raise prices as they face political pressure .  Trump has criticized companies such as Mattel and Amazon for raising prices . Cook has previously said that Apple depends on China for the skill of its workforce . Trump has also criticized companies like Mattel, which is considering raising prices, and Amazon .  Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs have meant that businesses such as Apple are also facing economic uncertainty . Last week, the U.S. struck a deal with Chinese officials to roll back most tariffs for 90 days . Apple has been monitoring the potential impact of tariffs .",positive,"tariffs, apple, iphones, iphone, smartphone"

Sam Altman’s X account, knows that the startup has been extremely busy lately . Jony Ive is most famous for his work with Apple .  Ive is poised to assume both “deep design and creative responsibilities” at both OpenAI and io.com . The high price paid by OpenAI indicates that it is more committed than ever to procuring a share of this market .  Some experts see this as an important step toward accomplishing these goals .

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS last month that the work of ""millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones"" would come to the United States and be automated . But he later told CNBC that Cook told him that doing so requires technology not yet available . The fastest way for the Trump administration to pressure Apple through tariffs would be to use the same legal mechanism behind punishing tariffs on a broad swath of imports .  Experts say IEEPA is not clear that courts have the power to review the president's response to a declared emergency . Other means of levying company-specific tariffs rely on lengthy investigations . But tariffs on only Apple would provide a competitive advantage for other important phones, expert says .  Court of International Trade is considering whether IEEPA authorizes tariffs at all .

" Apple CEO Tim Cook has been friendlier with President Trump than most big-company executives . Trump has threatened a 25% tariff on iPhones unless Apple makes them in the United States . Apple's stock sank 3% on the news and is down 22% for the year .  Trump is basing most of his tariffs on the premise that trade deficits constitute a ""national emergency"" That's a novel approach that lets Trump impose tariffs simply by issuing executive orders . Several lawsuits are challenging Trump's ability to do this, but unless courts intervene, the new approach allows Trump to fine-tune his tariffs .  Apple is unusual among tech giants in that its main offering is actually a physical product rather than software packaged as a service . Services account for nearly 80% of the US economy, and that's where most of the jobs of the future lie . Trump's entire trade agenda fixates on products rather than services .  Even with a 25% tariff, it makes no sense to move iPhone production to the United States . Trump is less hostile toward India and Vietnam, so it's reasonable to think he'll impose fewer barriers on imports from those countries . But there's no place to hide once Trump starts imposing tariffs on product-by-product basis .  If all smartphones came with a 25% tariff, Apple might be less disadvantaged . Cook might still be able to work some kind of deal with Trump that involves other types of domestic spending that would satisfy Trump .  If Trump does impose tariffs on iPhones, it would be under emergency authority .

" President Donald Trump threatens to slap a 25% tariff on the popular device . Apple for decades has been building most of its devices in China, where it has invested tens of billions of dollars . Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the March-June period would come from India .  Most analysts believe if Apple somehow could suddenly start making iPhones in the U.S., prices for the devices would soar to at least $2,000 and possibly might rise as high as $3,500 . The disincentives for Apple shifting its production domestically include a complex supply chain that Cook began to engineer during the 1990s while he was working for his predecessor, Steve Jobs .  Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives says moving iPhone production in the U.S. is a 'nonstarter' He estimates the price of an iPhone made in China or India would soar to more than $3,000 if production shifted to the U., he says . Ives predicts Cook will engage in a “game of negotiations” with Trump that would spare the iPhone from tariffs .  Cook said tariffs had a “limited impact” on the company in the March quarter because it was able to optimize its supply chain . Cook warned that it is “very difficult” to predict beyond June “because I’m not sure what will happen with tariffs”  Apple has had wiggle room to hold the line on iPhone pricing because of its service revenue . The company continues to reap huge profit margins from the revenue generated by subscriptions and other services tied to its product . A federal judge recently issued an order barring Apple from collecting commissions on transactions within iPhone apps .  U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted tariffs would force a shift in manufacturing . Apple CEO Cook expressed doubt about whether the U.K. labor pool had enough workers with the skills required to do the work .  “ fill multiple football fields” fill multiple fields,” says former NFL star . “I’m sure it’s not just a football field filled with football fields. fill multiple stadiums,’ says former player .",neutral,"tariffs, tariff, iphones, apple, iphone"

Stock indexes in the U .S. and across Europe fell, although they pared earlier sharper losses .  Trump's renewed trade threats against Apple and the EU disrupt the period of relative calm in global trade tensions, raising risks for tech and multinational firms ahead of low-liquidity holiday weekend in the United States .

" The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump's ability to disrupt the global economy . Trump was upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero .  The EU’s top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, posted on social media site X that he spoke Friday with U.S. trade officials . “The EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.”  Apple joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House's crosshairs . Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed .  Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India . After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price . Stocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%.  Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf” The goal was to have Apple bring more of its chip supply chain into the U.S.  German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market” Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies .  Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a trade deal . Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump .

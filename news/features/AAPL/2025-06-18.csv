" Motley Fool analysts Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger join host Ricky Mulvey to discuss macro uncertainty and market bullishness . Malcolm Ethridge, managing partner at Capital Area Planning Group, drops by to chat about the state of cybersecurity and why investors may be a little too pessimistic aboutApple's future .  Stock Advisor’s total average return is791% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to174% for the S&P 500 . Netflix, Nvidiamade this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $660,821!  Motley Fool senior analysts Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser join Ricky Mulvey on the Internet today . They discuss the recent news that Israel struck Iran's nuclear sites and military leadership .  It does sound like it's something that could be somewhat protracted . Oil prices have popped on this news, and the dollar has a flight to the dollar, I think . Let's hope that it's not something that continues to escalate .  Matt Argersinger: As investors, I think we yearn for certainty in an uncertain world . Ricky Mulvey: The Standard and Poor's 500 is still within spitting distance of all time highs .  Jason Kagan: The market backdrop could not look worse for me as an investor right now . But, Ricky Mulvey: I guess I'm just amazed by the market's resiliency and Friday's sell off notwithstanding . Kagan says it's not like the stock market should be within two or three percentage points of an all time high .  Jason Moser: It does feel like we shouldn't maybe be in such a good position in regard to the markets . But I guess when you look at it at its core, we continue to see strong corporate earnings, and that's obviously very encouraging . The economy, we were talking about this last week, it is still ultimately fairly resilient .  A Redfin report says that US home sellers are sitting on $700 billion worth of listings . That's up 20% a year ago and an all time high . Another Redfin analysis found that there are nearly half-a-million more home sellers than buyers .  Almost half the number of home values have been sitting on the market for 60 days or longer . The median US home sales price is up 1.4% year over year . Sellers want to sell but they're not willing to cut the price, at least enough to really move inventory .  The housing supply might be getting unstuck, but maybe now we actually need to start focusing more on the demand side . Ricky Mulvey: If mortgage rates don't come down or sellers aren't willing to cut the price, we might still have this mismatch in supply and demand .  Matt Argersinger: Stay patient and save for a down payment . Jason Moser: Buyers are not used to being in a buyer's market . Ricky Mulvey: Up next, we're looking at big tech earnings .  Jason Moser: In the first quarter of 2025, we definitely saw an increase in the number of IPOs in the US . There is this feeling that private equity firms are looking to start divesting some holdings, which ultimately leads to more IPO activity . Moser says we could see in the back half of 2025 and going into 2026, we'll continue to see modest enthusiasm in getting IPOs coming back to public market .  Ricky Mulvey: With Chime, I think the one thing to keep in mind is, remember, this IPO and you got the company value today at 10, 11, $12 billion . That's down from, like, it was a valuation of $25 billion at their last fundraise in 2021 . Ricky: ""Modest enthusiasm is the key theme that I think we should dig into""  This is not a bank, but it partners with a couple of banks in order to be able to provide these services, the Bancorp Bank and Stride Bank . The company makes most of its money just through card interchange processing fees . On one hand, there's an interesting growth profile here that could be in play .  Matt and Ricky Mulvey take a look at RH, Chime, RH and Chime . Chime is one of the first publicly traded companies to be publicly traded . RH is the aspirationally priced furniture retailer .  Matt Argersinger: The company reported a surprise profit, and the stock jumped 20% this morning . He says revenue grew 12% year over year, but inventories were up 26% . The company maintained its full year guidance, as well, so that's good, he says .  RH is still predicting double digit sales growth . Ricky Mulvey: The business is sound, and the profit was nice to see for the quarter . Matt Argersinger: ""I don't think I can glean any big insights about the economy""  Ricky Mulvey: For newer investors, this is a letter that I would encourage you to read because Gary Friedman is a wonderful writer. It's actually a fun read, and it is also a time for you to exercise your skepticism radar . Ricky Mulveve: ""Our debt is reflective of a washtub bet on ourselves. We repurchased 60% of our outstanding shares that greatly benefited our long term shareholders post the publishing of Mr. Buffett's letter in 2016-2017.  Adobe's net debt, by the way, is almost twice where it was before the pandemic . Jason Moser: This is a rare bird that is actually raising guidance right now . Ricky Mulvey: The membership discounts going up 5%. We'll also call that a washtub bet.  Adobe raised guidance all the way around, which is very encouraging, and the quarter was a good one . Ricky Mulvey: The big question about the growth is AI. What does AI mean for Adobe? Can creators get to good enough with free and other tools? Adobe's response seems to be, if you want the best tools, you still need free .  Adobe is considered to be one of the leaders in the space, but there's no question it's competitive position is under more attack today . Jason Moser: We're seeing encouraging numbers with things like Firefly, like you mentioned, and how it's bringing AI into its portfolio .  Malcolm Ethridge: Almost all the top officials at the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency have departed the agency or will do so in this month . The latest spending bill that's going around slashes the budget for this agency by about $500 million . Ethridge talks about the state of cybersecurity and why investors may be pessimistic about Apple's future .  Ricky Mulvey: CISA is the most important cybersecurity agency in the U.S. government . Mulvey says CISA coordinate with companies likeMicrosoft,Google,AmazonWeb Services, and share information back and forth to make sure that each other is aware of bigger threats .  Malcolm Ethridge: Are there any companies you think in this zone, in the cybersecurity area that are particularly prone if there are federal spending cuts to cybersecurity? Ethridge started investing in stand-alone cybersecurity companies about three years ago .  DOD specifically was leading the charge along with CISA, trying to get to what's called the zero trust environment, which is the standard today as far as how we're supposed to interact with our technology inside of an entity . Palo Alto Networks is one of the largest suppliers of those services to the government today .  Ricky Mulvey: A lot of these cybersecurities, at this time of federal spending uncertainty, there is a lot of excitement about what artificial intelligence means for the needs for cybersecurity as spoofing becomes easier . I think that's one of the reasons you're seeing a lot . You're seeing companies, including Palo Alto Networks, Zscaler, CrowdStrike, at or near all time highs .  Malcolm Ethridge: ""I'm not necessarily bearish on the space. I'm hesitant to cast such a wide net and say anything calling itself AI security, cybersecurity with an AI tilt, we should throw money at it without really investigating""  When we talk about what AI has allowed bad actors to be able to do, there's this new thing called a zero click attack . The fact that you opened it and it's in your environment, it now can talk to the AI agent inside of whatever that device is . Maybe Apple is at an advantage by being at a disadvantage with their AI component so far .  Malcolm Ethridge: Only two companies that I own as a direct cyber investment are CrowdStrike and Zscaler . The only two companies are leading the charge as far as being able to build to meet a bad actor who can run these attacks at scale .  Both companies have adopted a new model, ZFlex and Falcon Flex, which they both call them, respectively . I think that's a place where both companies will grow their annually recurring revenue, which is the core target financially that they are telling shareholders to focus on .  AVGO is thatBroadcomis the Number 1 holding, at a 9-10% weighting, depending on which day you look at it . Infosys, Cisco, CrowdStrike and Palo Alto are among the top five cybersecurity-related holdings in the ETF .  A good reminder for people to check under the hood when they buy an ETF because the headline might not always be what you're getting . Ricky Mulvey: For me, that's something that's attractive as an ETF for cybersecurity, especially, this is a space that I know I'm less knowledgeable about . Malcolm Ethridge: Apple is in a tough spot in the sense that we as investors are looking to them and saying, what's next?  Most of what we've done with AI so far for the last three years, since ChatGPT hit the scene, has been at the enterprise level . For Apple, maybe the liquid glass reconstruction is meant to mirror what the vision goggles will show you and there's a goal to tie those in together .  Apple Intelligence wasn't really what we were told it was going to be. Maybe for Apple, this is a bridge to get you used to the interface of the liquid glass, and then everybody will put on the headset and feel less out of place . But in the meantime, investors are looking and going, but that's not exciting to me today. That's not enough of a reason for consumers to line up outside of an Apple store .  Apple needs to be able to tell a compelling story about how they're going to participate in the next leg of AI enabled smartphone device interaction . They haven't yet yet, but I feel like we've been saying that about Apple for two years . Leads me to believe we've reached peak pessimism on Apple shares .  Malcolm Ethridge: ""All the bad news is out there, and investors still seem to be sticking with it and giving Apple the benefit of the doubt"" Ricky Mulvey: ""Perhaps an underappreciated capital allocation story"" Mulvey says Apple has been aggressively taking shares off the market, and they still have a $100 billion buyback plan .

Now, Ives says the bull case is ""back on the table"" for tech stocks such asApple, Microsoft, andPalantir Technologies .  Apple and other tech companies could benefit from the new tariff agreement . The deal would allow them to continue manufacturing in China without seeing an extreme increase in costs . Ives says the deal is a ""game changer"" for the tech industry as a whole .

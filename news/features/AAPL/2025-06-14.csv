" Apple(AAPL) disappointed both fans and investors at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) This year, the highly anticipated event resulted in AAPL stock falling hard as investors reacted negatively to a disappointing update regarding one of Apple's flagship products .  The past month has brought numerous complications for Apple, primarily from Capitol Hill . President Donald Trump has made it clear that he doesn’t want the company to build iPhones in India, despite CEO Tim Cook’s plans to invest $500 billion in manufacturing in the U.S. over the coming years .  A well-known AAPL stock bull, Ives noted that the event revealed “slow and steady improvements"" but still described it as “overall a yawner” CEO Ross Gerber is known for his blunt takes on tech stocks . Gerber also expressed strong disdain for Apple’s strategy .  Gerber’s statement could point to bigger problems that lie ahead, with the potential to compromise AAPL stock's growth . Gerber: Apple's legacy centers around products designed with simplicity and user ease, two things that Jobs emphasized in his work leading the company .  If Apple is indeed falling far from the tree, as Gerber suggests, it could end up disappointing its customers even more . That said, other experts have a more positive outlook on Apple’s chances of a rebound than Ives and Gerber . Wall Street veteran Chris Versace recently laid out his team's outlook for Apple .

This is currently a major tailwind for TSMC, driving a 41.6% year-over-year revenue surge .  The company is investing $165 billion in U.S. factories, with Arizona’s first fab already fully booked by heavyweights like Nvidia and Qualcomm . In Europe, a new $10 billion plant in Dresden, Germany, and a chip design center in Munich are positioning TSMC to capture the continent's growing AI market .  TSMC has an aggressive capital expenditure plan of $38–$42 billion for this year, up from $29.8 billion in 2024 . Over 70% of that spending is allocated to next-generation 3nm and 2nm chip production . Despite TSMC’s explosive growth, the stock remains attractively valued .  The AI boom is a multi-year tailwind, driving sustained top and bottom-line growth . With over 60% global foundry market share and ongoing global expansion, TSMC’s scale and strategic positioning make that valuation look like a bargain .

" In 1999, PC World declared the personal computer the most important invention of the last 100 years . To celebrate, we put together an article looking back at 100 defining moments in computing history .  Apple’s upcoming iPadOS 26 operating system pushes tablet far closer to the Mac . Jesus Diaz argues that the shift not only overcomplicates the iPad but also violates Raskin's decades-old principles about how to make computing easy and intuitive . In 1979, Apple's 31st employee started at the company as its publications manager .  Raskin oversaw the development of a short-lived machine that stuck closer to his vision, the Canon Cat . After leaving Apple, he continued exploring ways to make computing more approachable . He died in 2005 .  The most accurate account of the Mac’s history that I have seen in print is in Apple Confidential . I do not think that the famous visit to PARC had much influence at all on the design . What it did do was get rid of Jobs’ antipathy to interface-oriented design and allowed us to proceed without his earlier opposition to the Mac project .  Engineers from PARC made the Mac interface more PARClike (and, in my opinion, harder to use, but spiffier and probably more marketable). Today’s interfaces are far more pleasant and interactive, at least on the surface, than what they replaced . They are convoluted, complex, opaque, and remarkably prone to crashing at the least provocation .  It will take a company with guts and financial strength to stand behind the radical improvement we need . Consumers will be standing up and cheering to be out from under the yoke of today’s antihuman interfaces .  The iPhone and iPad were conceived entirely for touch input . Google's Chromebooks turned the web browser into a full-blown computing environment . Amazon gave us Alexa, an assistant you could summon by talking to a speaker .  Apple has rolled out interface updates for computers, phones, tablets, watches, TV boxes, and headsets . With iPadOS 26, Apple is applying that same paradigm to the iPad . Even if you're impressed by them, it sounds like the scaling problem Raskin saw in 1999, times six .  Back in 1999, I quoted Raskin's point about Jobs’s PARC visit warming him to the potential of the embryonic Mac project . But even that didn’t get into his harsh assessment of current interfaces . Chromebooks started out rejecting native apps as an idea before succumbing to temptation to support Android ones .  The question remains a good starting point for judging new products . Holding them to high standards, as Raskin did, is the best way to answer it .  Meta is betting big on a new superintelligence lab, luring talent with massive paychecks and bringing in Scale AI’s Alexandr Wang . Insiders warn that deep internal dysfunction could sabotage the effort . Hinge is teaming up with Esther Perel to rethink dating prompts .

" President Donald Trump’s tariff regime may not be having the desired effect of bringing manufacturing back to the US yet . At first-quarter conferences, executives touted their “Made in America” credentials at a record rate . Companies in the S&P 500 Index called out domestic production over 200 times, compared with a 25-year average of around 50 mentions per earnings season .  Despite the patriotic enthusiasm, there’s little evidence corporate America has broken ground on new domestic facilities . Many commitments weren’t new or were in line with previous spending patterns . Touting new projects in response to tariffs could appear reactive .  The threat of retaliation from the White House has some companies seeking advice on how to stay out of trouble . Trump has showered ire on firms who he sees flouting the “America First” mindset by taking production abroad .  Management commentary on where the business is heading is critical, especially as specific financial outlooks become less reliable . CEO Ynon Kreiz took time to detail the company’s plans to decrease its exposure to Chinese suppliers by shifting more production to India .  At least 50 major US companies have withdrawn or suspended their outlooks as economic conditions make forecasting too difficult . Snap-on Inc.

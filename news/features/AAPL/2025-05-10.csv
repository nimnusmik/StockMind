" Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s revenue jumped 48% in April . The main chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. reported monthly sales of NT$349.6 billion . That compares with the average analysts’ estimate for a 38% rise in second-quarter revenue .  The Trump administration has decided to roll back some Biden-era AI chip curbs as part of a broader effort to revise unpopular global semiconductor trade restrictions . That’s a potential boon to TSMC in the short run, though the administration is drafting its own version of the rules .  Long-term uncertainty abounds ahead of new, tighter export controls expected soon . The US administration is set to implement new — likely stricter — measures, focused on blocking China’s indirect access to US-designed AI chips .",positive,"chipmaker, manufacturing, taiwan, china, apple"
" In this podcast, Jim Gillies and Dylan Lewis discuss Warren Buffett's plan to step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway . The parallels between Berkshire's succession planning and Apple's transition from Steve Jobs to Tim Cook . The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years .  Stock Advisor’s total average return is909% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to162% for the S&P 500 . If you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $717,471!  Buffett announced his retirement at Berkshire Hath Hath Hathaway's annual meeting in Omaha over the weekend . One of his friends on the floor texted him with literally as he was speaking going, holy insert golf word here .  Buffett has been prepping people for this for nearly two decades, Dylan says . Buffett reiterated many times over the years, including in this most recent annual meeting is like, you know what? Take your time, think through, things things are not that imperative in the moment .  The board voted unanimously along with Warren's suggestion hands up, who thought that wouldn't happen . Two board members are Warren's kids who, as you said, knew about this . Jim Gillies: This is the start of 2026 .  Jim Gillies: Buffett would be useful, perhaps reputation wise to help deploy some of the $350 billion they've got now . Gillies says he doesn't think a lot's going to change, and part of that is because they've been gradually transitioning the day to day operating business into the hands of Greg Abel .  Dylan Lewis: I would be a happy buyer of shares today without a thing and without a concern, frankly . I see the stock fell as much as 6 or 7% today. I wish it fell more. I hope it falls more in the next week or so .  There are core Berkshire principles to the way that we approach things, and that probably isn't going to change very much . Abel and Buffett both talked quite a bit at the annual meeting about the importance of being balance sheet oriented .  Warren Buffett has been a long term Buffett slash Berkshire shareholder slash Berkshire follower . He'll be 95 at the end of the summer . The balance sheets will continue to be the guide for how this management team is making decisions .  Buffett unwinding some of the large positions that existed with Bank of America with Apple over the years and really putting Abel and the management team in a position to make decisions that they were excited about . That followed Berkshire playbook and probably to be opportunistic as there's possibly some clouds out there .  Apple is unquestionably the best a stock investment that Buffett has made, says Dylan Lewis . Dylan Lewis: Buffett downplayed some of the people saying, Oh, you're just trying to set up things for Greg Abel .  Tim Cook has been a far better CEO for Apple than Steve Jobs was . Tim Cook doesn't get this opportunity without Steve Jobs and without the vision and the idea . Cook is an execution guy. Jobs is an idea guy .  The sheer value that's been created at Apple in the Tim Cook era greatly outstrips what was created during the Steve Jobs era . Dylan Lewis: Buffett has put all seeds in play and has put the culture in play, and has been slowly farming out bits and pieces of the business to key players at Berkshire .  Buffett is essentially talking about his own business, Jim Gillies says . Gillies: Will Greg Abel be able to create some of the magic that we've seen in stock picking? He says Apple has been the last real big home run. Buffett got out of the airlines during COVID.  The optics of having Warren Buffett one of the richest people on Earth through Berkshire Hathaway, it wasn't Warren Buffett owning them, but it was Berkshire . He also knew he didn't want to be the guy bailing out the airlines . That way, they can qualify reasonably well for government funding .  The stock picking over the past decade or so has not been spectacular aside from Apple . That is because this is a $1.15 trillion company with a bazillion different irons in the fires, and there's not a lot .  Berkshire is sitting on record levels of cash, and we know what cash is earning right now . The market is in the opposite direction, down about 4% year to date . Investors haven't seemed to mind giving them a little bit of time to put that money to work .  Jim Gillies: Expect that cash balance to never again drop below 50 billion . Dylan Lewis: There's room to go down when you have 350 billion . Nothing is going to change as long as Buffett is consuming oxygen .  I think nothing's going to change really for a little while longer. I think they will continue in reinvesting in their existing businesses. I would be shocked to see them make any meaningful draw down of that cash hoard. I don't think they're going out and buyingDisneytomorrow. I will say that would tickle me a little bit. They might but these are the types of businesses that would be fun .  The market may give Buffett the dislocating moment, Dylan Lewis says . Dylan Lewis: Buffett is in a better position to be in to have $350 billion in cash if you expect there may be a lot of headwinds away . Dylan: You want to look in a space where they already have an interest .  Jim Gillies: I don't know who's going to have the dominant operating system in 20 years . Dylan Lewis: People are going to still be eating Snickers, but you're probably going to be buying Snickers . The obvious things are more insurance, more energy consumer products with a significant brand mode .  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hath Hath Hathaway has been the cornerstone of his investing philosophy . Berkshire Hathaway is the largest one of his portfolio's ballast holdings . Brookfield, Fairfax Financial and Fairfax Financial are among the other ballast investments .  Buffett has said even this weekend this weekend, ""We don't care about that stuff"" Buffett has fallen, I don't know how many times by 50%. Doesn't bother us in the slightest. Focus on the business, all that wonderful stuff, but remember what he did back then .  Jim Gillies: Buffett's tenets, his investing style, remain the pillars of your portfolio . He seems to think that the business is in good hands with Greg running it. We don't know when they are coming. They will come. Probably be a Tuesday .

" A decade ago, when Microsoft Corp. was reined in by the Justice Department, a prominent Silicon Valley attorney popularized a theory about antitrust cases: “The trial is the remedy” The theory meant forcing a monopolist to defend its conduct could open up space for other companies to innovate . And today, it's happening with Alphabet Inc.’s Google .  Apple’s top dealmaker Eddy Cue said Apple is “actively looking at” revamping its Safari web browser to focus on AI-powered search engines . His comments indicate that while Google has worked to protect its core search business, AI companies have succeeded in building a viable alternative for answering questions on the internet .  The whole point of monopolization trials “is to shake things up,” Wu says . The second phase of the Google trial focused on how to address what a federal judge last year found to be an illegal monopoly . After closing arguments May 29 and 30, Judge Amit Mehta will determine whether to break up the company .  Apple had partnered with Google on online search since 2003, earning as much as $20 billion a year for making Google’s search engine the default option on its devices . Cue was intimately involved in negotiating that deal – in fact he had testified about it in 2023 as part of the first phase of its antitrust case .  Cue barely mentioned Gemini this week when he appeared in court for the Justice Department’s second phase trial . Cue appeared to be alluding to what Silicon Valley has described as an existential threat to search over the past two years . Apple still has yet to sign a deal to add Gemini to its phones .  Users can now get instant AI-generated answers directly from bots, which are drawing their responses from large repositories of existing human-generated data . Google said it has seen an overall increase in queries from Apple devices as users switch from text-based searches to using voice-activated and image-based search .  Google discovered the key technology for the large language models that underlies today’s AI startups . The government has argued that Google didn’t capitalize on that innovation because of its dominance in the market . Google maintains that it spends billions on innovation each year and waited to introduce AI features so that it could do so responsibly .  Google is concerned that people might then use landline phones less, Wu called it ""paranoia"" Google said the company hasn't seen AI cannibalize search, with only a small slice of homework and coding queries shifting .

" Alphabet could be bigger than Microsoft or Apple if it had the same premium for its stock . Alphabet's net income is far higher than either of these two companies .

In the first quarter, $61.6 billion of its $80.5 billion in revenue came from advertising-related sources . The market views this as a potential liability, as advertising budgets tend to get cut during an economic downturn . Still, Alphabet's situation is hardly different from that of Apple, as Apple relies on sales of consumer electronics .

Buffett announced his retirement at Berkshire Hath Hath Hathaway's annual meeting in Omaha over the weekend . One of his friends on the floor texted him with literally as he was speaking going, holy insert golf word here .  Buffett has been prepping people for this for nearly two decades, Dylan says . Buffett reiterated many times over the years, including in this most recent annual meeting is like, you know what? Take your time, think through, things things are not that imperative in the moment .  The board voted unanimously along with Warren's suggestion hands up, who thought that wouldn't happen . Two board members are Warren's kids who, as you said, knew about this . Jim Gillies: This is the start of 2026 .  Jim Gillies: Buffett would be useful, perhaps reputation wise to help deploy some of the $350 billion they've got now . Gillies says he doesn't think a lot's going to change, and part of that is because they've been gradually transitioning the day to day operating business into the hands of Greg Abel .  Dylan Lewis: I would be a happy buyer of shares today without a thing and without a concern, frankly . I see the stock fell as much as 6 or 7% today. I wish it fell more. I hope it falls more in the next week or so .  There are core Berkshire principles to the way that we approach things, and that probably isn't going to change very much . Abel and Buffett both talked quite a bit at the annual meeting about the importance of being balance sheet oriented .  Warren Buffett has been a long term Buffett slash Berkshire shareholder slash Berkshire follower . He'll be 95 at the end of the summer . The balance sheets will continue to be the guide for how this management team is making decisions .  Buffett unwinding some of the large positions that existed with Bank of America with Apple over the years and really putting Abel and the management team in a position to make decisions that they were excited about . That followed Berkshire playbook and probably to be opportunistic as there's possibly some clouds out there .  Apple is unquestionably the best a stock investment that Buffett has made, says Dylan Lewis . Dylan Lewis: Buffett downplayed some of the people saying, Oh, you're just trying to set up things for Greg Abel .  Tim Cook has been a far better CEO for Apple than Steve Jobs was . Tim Cook doesn't get this opportunity without Steve Jobs and without the vision and the idea . Cook is an execution guy. Jobs is an idea guy .  The sheer value that's been created at Apple in the Tim Cook era greatly outstrips what was created during the Steve Jobs era . Dylan Lewis: Buffett has put all seeds in play and has put the culture in play, and has been slowly farming out bits and pieces of the business to key players at Berkshire .  Buffett is essentially talking about his own business, Jim Gillies says . Gillies: Will Greg Abel be able to create some of the magic that we've seen in stock picking? He says Apple has been the last real big home run. Buffett got out of the airlines during COVID.  The optics of having Warren Buffett one of the richest people on Earth through Berkshire Hathaway, it wasn't Warren Buffett owning them, but it was Berkshire . He also knew he didn't want to be the guy bailing out the airlines . That way, they can qualify reasonably well for government funding .  The stock picking over the past decade or so has not been spectacular aside from Apple . That is because this is a $1.15 trillion company with a bazillion different irons in the fires, and there's not a lot .  Berkshire is sitting on record levels of cash, and we know what cash is earning right now . The market is in the opposite direction, down about 4% year to date . Investors haven't seemed to mind giving them a little bit of time to put that money to work .  Jim Gillies: Expect that cash balance to never again drop below 50 billion . Dylan Lewis: There's room to go down when you have 350 billion . Nothing is going to change as long as Buffett is consuming oxygen .  I think nothing's going to change really for a little while longer. I think they will continue in reinvesting in their existing businesses. I would be shocked to see them make any meaningful draw down of that cash hoard. I don't think they're going out and buyingDisneytomorrow. I will say that would tickle me a little bit. They might but these are the types of businesses that would be fun .  The market may give Buffett the dislocating moment, Dylan Lewis says . Dylan Lewis: Buffett is in a better position to be in to have $350 billion in cash if you expect there may be a lot of headwinds away . Dylan: You want to look in a space where they already have an interest .  Jim Gillies: I don't know who's going to have the dominant operating system in 20 years . Dylan Lewis: People are going to still be eating Snickers, but you're probably going to be buying Snickers . The obvious things are more insurance, more energy consumer products with a significant brand mode .  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hath Hath Hathaway has been the cornerstone of his investing philosophy . Berkshire Hathaway is the largest one of his portfolio's ballast holdings . Brookfield, Fairfax Financial and Fairfax Financial are among the other ballast investments .  Buffett has said even this weekend this weekend, ""We don't care about that stuff"" Buffett has fallen, I don't know how many times by 50%. Doesn't bother us in the slightest. Focus on the business, all that wonderful stuff, but remember what he did back then .  Jim Gillies: Buffett's tenets, his investing style, remain the pillars of your portfolio . He seems to think that the business is in good hands with Greg running it. We don't know when they are coming. They will come. Probably be a Tuesday .

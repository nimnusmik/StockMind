" Artificial intelligence has been an epic catalyst for the likes of Nvidia and many of its big tech peers . Amazon has witnessed a near-trillion-dollar surge in its own valuation during the AI revolution . While Nvidia has a higher market cap than Amazon today, the e-commerce giant could leapfrog its semiconductor counterpart the end of the decade .  Amazon reports its revenue across six major categories: e-commerce, physical stores, third-party seller services, advertising, subscriptions, and Amazon Web Services . While AI has the potential to disrupt all of Amazon's operational segments, AWS and retail are the two that have me most encouraged . I think the company could be worth much more than semiconductor giant by next decade .  Amazon is outfitting its fulfillment centers with robotic processes that can bring a new level of automation and efficiency to packaging and shipping services . Amazon should be able to reduce labor costs over time, resulting in greater profitability for its core retail operation .  Amazon is in the early phases of developing its own AI chips . Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabetare pursuing similar ambitions . While I don't think this will be catastrophic for Nvidia, it likely won't help it in the long run . Investors might want to prepare for less robust growth in Nvidia's sales and profits .  Amazon appears to be in the early stages of taking advantage of new opportunities for accelerated growth . Amazon's valuation trends suggest that investors are not yet placing much of a premium at all on the company's efficiency improvements or long-run potential . Amazon should be in a position to continue accelerating sales while minting billions in cash flow in the process .  On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a“Double Down” stockrecommendation for companies that they think are about to pop . Nvidia:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009,you’d have $295,164!* Apple: If you invested  in Apple in 2008, you'd have $37,708!* Netflix: If  you invested in Netflix in 2004, you’ve got $611,589!

" Apple (AAPL) stock has bounced back impressively after last month’s tariff-driven sell-off sent it tumbling . With management radiating confidence and a hefty $100 billion buyback program in place, Apple's stock looks like a sturdy ship, even at its lofty price .  Apple's fiscal Q2 revenue was $95.4 billion, up 5% year-over-year, topping Wall Street's $94.68 billion forecast . iPhone sales came in strong at $46.8 billion, above the $45.6 billion expected . Mac revenue jumped 6.7% to $7.5 billion, fueled by the M4 MacBook Air . Services, the profit engine, soared 11.6% and set a new record .  Apple's Q2 profitability was a sight to behold . Net income rose to $24.8 billion and gross margins hit a stellar 46.9%, among the company's best ever . The secret sauce is a high-margin Services segment .  Apple expected gross margins to 45.5%-46.5% in Q3, below the 46.58% analysts hoped for . Cook noted years of supply chain diversification (half of U.S.-bound iPhones now from India, most Macs and iPads from Vietnam) cushion the blow .  At 28.5x this year’s expected EPS, Apple is no steal for a company growing in the mid-single digits . However, by leaning on domestic chip sourcing and a flexible supply chain alone, Apple has built a safeguard against trade wars that could sustain its growth . The $100 billion buyback program should continue to translate to elevated buying volumes for the stock .  Apple’s fiscal Q2 results demonstrate that the company is not just weathering tariff headwinds but is thriving despite them . With $95.4 billion in revenue, booming Services, and a supply chain dodging tariff blows, Apple's in fighting shape . The $100 billion buyback and unmatched ecosystem make it a solid buy, making me confident that Apple will keep shining .",positive,"apple, profitability, sales, profit, revenue"
" Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia have the most realistic chance of reaching the $4 trillion club first . Microsoft is racing to fill a $315 billion order backlog from customers who need more computing capacity for their artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions . Nvidia might be much further away from the mark, but it could legitimately achieve the milestone .  Since 2019, Microsoft invested around $14 billion in AI start-up OpenAI . Microsoft combined OpenAI's latest AI models with its own to create the Copilot virtual assistant . Copilot is now integrated into the company's flagship software products like Windows, Bing, and Edge, for free . It's available for subscribers of the 365 productivity suite for an additional monthly fee .  Microsoft said there were hundreds of thousands of organizations using Copilot for 365 around the world . CEO Satya Nadella said a record number of customers opted to buy more licenses during the quarter . The company rolled out new Copilot features to encourage more subscribers to upgrade .  Microsoft accounts for its AI cloud revenue under its Azure AI segment . Azure AI accounted for a record-high 16 percentage points (almost half) of that figure . The company opened new data centers in 10 countries in the third quarter alone .  Microsoft allocated $21.4 billion to capital expenditures (capex) during the third quarter, most of which went toward data center infrastructure . Microsoft is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.6 as of this writing . It's sitting roughly between Apple stock, which trades at a P/E ratio of 31.9 and Nvidia stock .  Microsoft is growing its EPS below trend at the moment, partly because of its enormous data center spending which is weighing on its profitability . According to Wall Street's consensus estimate, the company could increase its earnings by 12.8% in fiscal 2026 .  The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years .

" Apple cautioned investors that steep import tariffs will take a toll on profits beginning this quarter . iPhone sales remain lethargic, with last quarter’s measurable growth mostly rooted in unusual circumstances . Tariffs are arguably the least of Apple's problems right now, if you dig deeper into its historical results .  Apple turned $95.4 billion in revenue into earnings of $1.65 per share in fiscal Q3 . The iPhone accounted for roughly half of Apple's business, with sales of $46.8 billion . The company's services arm continues to shine as well .  iPhone unit sales of the iPhone improved 10% year over year, but that's a 10% improvement on a figure that fell by nearly as much in the comparable quarter a year earlier . Actual iPhone revenue remains more or less in line with where it peaked in 2022 .  The iPhone accounts for half of Apple's sales, and presumably, a comparable percentage of its profits . Without this push, it's conceivable that last quarter's iPhone business might have actually fallen . Apple didn't embrace this next generation of AI chatbots in earnest until last year .  Apple's AI chief has been removed as head of Siri's ongoing development . Tim Cook was forced to concede during the recent earnings call that the implementation of a new-and-improved Siri is ""just taking a bit longer than we thought"" Apple is usually isolationist, and such a decision confirms just how far behind its AI efforts .  Apple is steering customers to its competitors on AI-powered virtual assistants . Does this spell doom? Hardly . If nothing else, Apple remains the world's most profitable company .  The bottom line? Apple isn't necessarily a sell here . There's even a wobbly case for stepping into the stock while it's down more than 20% from its December peak . Apple's services business also remains impressive, even if it's not its flagship business .  Stock Advisor’s total average return is894% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to163% for the S&P 500 . Consider when Netflixmade this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $611,589!  Tariffs are the least of Apple's problems right now, according to The Motley Fool . The company's stock has more than 1.6 million shares .",negative,"iphone, apple, profits, revenue, earnings"

" Warren Buffett's simple investing strategy propeled Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating returns since 1965 . Buffett typically invests in growing companies with reliable profits and strong management teams . He plans to step down at the end of this year, but he will continue serving as chairman of the board .  Buffett's strategy has been so successful that a $1,000 investment in Berkshire stock in 1965 would have been worth a staggering $44.7 million at the end of 2024 . Berkshire holds a number of dividend-paying stocks, but three of them represent 47.7% of its $282 billion portfolio .  Apple is still Berkshire's largest holding with a 21.7% weighting in its portfolio . So far this year, Berkshire earned a quarterly dividend payment of $0.25 per share from Apple . Buffett and his team sold half the position last year to reduce some of the concentration risk .  American Express is a global payments giant with a presence in over 200 countries . Berkshire spent $1.3 billion accumulating a stake in American Express during the 1990s . Berkshire currently owns one-fifth of the entire company, and its 151.6 million shares are currently worth $44.9 billion .  Buffett accumulated 400 million shares in Coca-Cola on Berkshire's behalf between 1988 and 1994, spending around $1.3 billion in total . The position is now worth a whopping $28.5 billion, which accounts for 10.1% of the conglomerate's portfolio .  Coca-Cola increased its dividend at the start of 2025, paying $0.51 per share during the first quarter . That's likely to remain at that level for the rest of the year if history is any guide, placing Berkshire on track to earn $2.04 in dividends per share in 2025 . Assuming it doesn't sell any of its 400 million shares, that means the conglomerate stands to earn an additional $816 million in payments .  The Motley Fool’s total average return is997% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to172% for the S&P 500 .

" Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference begins this Monday, June 9 . The five-day event has historically been aimed at developers, but consumer fans can’t wait to tune in to the keynote address that kicks off the event . This year, Apple's software changes are likely to be more transformative than they’ve been in over a decade .  Apple will be rebranding its iOS numbering scheme for all of its operating systems . They will no longer be numbered sequentially (for example, iOS 16, iOS 17, iOS 18) Instead, they will be numbered by year . New iOS Apple will introduce on Monday at WWDC25 will be known as “iOS 26” The “26” stands for the year 2026 .  Apple will likely use iOS 26 in its WWDC25 keynote to showcase the radical design changes coming to all its operating systems . The new OSes are said to take heavy inspiration from the current visionOS, which powers theApple Vision Pro .  iPad's new operating system will receive the same new visual redesign iOS 26 and Apple’s other OSes are getting . iPadOS will also get the same accessibility upgrades and new gaming app that iOS 26 is getting . But Bloomberg reports that iPadOS could actually get more “Mac-like” this year .  Apple may bring Apple Intelligence to the Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro, and Apple Watch for the first time . The Apple Watch's hardware lacks the processing power to run Apple Intelligence on-device . For the Apple Watch, it will rely on offloading the processing of Apple Intelligence requests to a connected iPhone .  Apple could unveil a new Mac Pro at WWDC25 . The event is traditionally a software-focused event . The new iPhone range is expected to be unveiled in the fall .  The conference kicks off on Monday, June 9, with the WWDC keynote scheduled for 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m . The visual redesign may be the most significant announcement at WWDC from an investor perspective . Apple stock has fallen over 18% since the beginning of the year .  Apple is up nearly 5% in the past 12 months, with the stock price just under $204 . Any tariff that Trump implements on goods from China could significantly impact Apple’s bottom line .",neutral,"ios, apple, 2026, ipad, ipados"
" Apple shares have been a monster winner in the past, as its products and services gained widespread global adoption . Investors should be concerned about the growth trajectory of the iPhone, which is being negatively impacted by Apple’s slow AI rollout . A lower starting valuation would certainly add upside to this top tech stock .  In the fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended March 29), this single product generated $47 billion in revenue for Apple . The issue is that this sales figure was up only 2% year over year . Maybe by 2030, a new device will be created that changes how people interact with technology .  Critics have called out Apple's failure to create the next game-changing hardware device that can push the financial needle . Apple was reportedly working on an electric car for a decade . Apple shut down this project last year .  Apple generated $400 billion in companywide sales in the past four fiscal quarters . Lower growth prospects and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31.6 are key headwinds . If the valuation drops to a P/E of 25, then the situation is more interesting .  The Motley Fool's total average return is997% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to172% for the S&P 500 .

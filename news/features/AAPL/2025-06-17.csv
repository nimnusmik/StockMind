" The administration has used many rationales for tariffs, but the one that seems to animate the president most is a wish to bring manufacturing back home to the U.S. Over the past few decades, many industries including tech have shipped most of their production overseas . But reversing the status quo for companies like Apple isfar more complicated than Trump lets on .  Manufacturing has steadily declined as a share of U.S. GDP, from around 25% in the 1950s to 10% today . China, in particular, has captured much of the world’s manufacturing, thanks to a massive pool of skilled labor and deeply integrated supply chains .  China has 105 million manufacturing workers than the U.S. over 13 million . China has installed over half of the world’s industrial robots .  Some final assembly for U.S. Big Tech has moved to “China plus one” destinations like Vietnam, India, and Mexico . Apple, for example, has abruptly switched tosourcing more than half of its smartphone manufacturing .  China could continue to be a major supplier of iPhones for non-U.S. markets while India supplies the U.S., Indian markets . Meanwhile, Vietnam would assemble Apple’s other products such as Mac laptops .  Trump is not a fan of Apple’s shift to India, threatening tariffs on any iPhone not made in the U.S. A145% tariff on Chinese goods, or even one at the 54% level first proposed by Trump on April 2, would have wiped out trade between the two countries . Anything supplied by China would have become unaffordable immediately .  After initially creating turmoil in the financial markets, Trump has backtracked on many of his original tariff plans . No one knows what will come next, which makes it difficult for businesses to plan much of anything .  Even without tariffs, reshoring is a ‘fool’s errand, says Roberts . Trade deals are not legally binding, trade deals aren’t enforceable, nor is the Trump administration bound by its own promises . Many companies are wary of pledging large investments in the U.S.  From the start, tech companies have tried to curry favor with the Trump administration to influence his policies . How much of that courtship is a product of the trade war and what it might accomplish are unclear . Fasteau thinks the answer is more investment in automation .  The U.S. needs to decide what kind of manufacturing it really wants, Fasteau says . The answer, despite what Lutnick says, likely isn’t a U .S.-based iPhone factory . “If they really want iPhone manufacturing, they should go visit China,"" Xing says .",negative,"tariffs, tariff, manufacturing, china, industries"

Eric Trump suggested the pitch is patriotism, emphasizing that the phones will be built in the U.S. Eric Trump is the president’s son running The Trump Organization in his absence .  Eric Trump says consumers deserve a phone that aligns with their values . Vietnam was approved last month, though the deal was in the works before Trump was elected . Trump has already used the main regulatory agency that will oversee Trump Mobile in personal disputes .  Donald Trump ventured into the telecommunication industry once before, giving speeches and promoting a multi-level marketing company called ACN that was eventuallysued for fraud and misleading . IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said the monthly fee of just under $50 is pricey, the appeal beyond the most ardent MAGA loyalists doubtful and the business difficult .  The mobile service is partnering with existing cellular carriers with access to a 5G network . The name given to the monthly service offer, The 47 Plan, and the monthly $47.45 monthly fee make reference to Trump’s two terms .

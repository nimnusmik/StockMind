" Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst atTF Securities, outlined three reasons why Trump persistently targets Apple in public . First, he noted that pressuring a global brand like Apple guarantees widespread media attention . Second, Apple rarely pushes back publicly, making it a low-risk target .  Earlier on Friday, Trump demanded that iPhones sold in the U.S. must be manufactured domestically, or the companycould face a 25% tariff . Trump's remarks were a direct response to Apple's expanding footprint in India, where its major supplier,Foxconn, is constructing a $1.5 billion display module facility near Chennai, India .  That Apple would likely find it more financially viable to absorb a 25% tariff on U.S. iPhone sales than to relocate its iPhone assembly operations back to the United States . ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones .",negative,"tariff, iphones, apple, iphone, phones"

" Motley Fool analyst Jim Gillies and host Ricky Mulvey discuss Nike's return toAmazon.com . The fundamentals and risks of investing in turnaround stories. A fitness company with a potentially brighter future. PubMatic CEO Rajeev Goel about trends in digital advertising and his company's future.  Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, available when you joinStock Advisor, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon . Apple:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008,you’d have $37,070!* Netflix: If you invested . $1k on Netflix in 2004, you'd have $639,271!  Nike is back to selling its products on Amazon . This is five years after pulling its products from the e-commerce giant . Jim Gillies: It's nice that Nike does the right thing after trying all the other alternatives . Gillies asks: Why would anyone want to sell inCostco, or through Walmart?  Foot Locker is an iconic brand with products and athletes that people identify with . It's been, I think, three and a half years since it topped out. This is a company that maxed out. It's an iconic company .  Nike is also in a tough environment to turn around, announcing that it's going to hike prices on June 1 . Ricky Mulvey: Turnarounds take a while. Nike's shed almost two thirds of its value over the past four years .  President Trump jawboned them down last weekend . The second they say, ""Our costs are higher, so we're going to have to pass a law on the costs caused by tariffs"" Ricky Mulvey: It's going to be interesting times for Nike in this new higher cost environment .  Nike has the Win Now plan, which is focusing on retail partners as we mentioned . Ricky Mulvey: It is difficult for companies to turn around. incredibly difficult. I don't want to discount Nike's ability, but there's also a pricing game that's going to be tough for them.  Turnarounds are difficult, and a lot of time turnaround doesn't last long . We have seen this story before, and the principles that I have when looking at any turnaround, first of all, are difficult . I have very fond memories .  The company turns around on the person who's trying to drive the turnaround . The second thing is, it's probably going to take you a long time and longer than you expect . Don't even throw any money at it or throw 0.1% tiny starter position .  One of the turnarounds that actually turned that I can appreciate is Chipotle . Ricky Mulvey: Chipotle in 2015, a very bad, terrible, awful year . Jim Gillies: It's nice that they went for the defense industry as well as the airline . Ricky: If you rushed in in the first year, boy, you've been waiting a long time for your money .  By the time you come along in 2016, the stock had already been knocked down by about 40 or 50% . In mid-2016, it's like, ""Evaluation is much better. They've at least paid lip service to improving the quality."" Ironically, a lot of it was tied to their whole food with integrity thing .  Chipotle was still dead money for another two and a half, almost three years . It was only after Founder Steve Ells is gone, and they bring in Brian Niccol from Taco Bell . Only then did Chipotle have its renaissance, Ricky Mulvey says .  Are there any current turnaround stories that you're more interested in than Nike? Gillies: I have no prediction, but you're not biting on Nike. would bet that in 10 years from now, 20 years later, people are still buying Nike shoes, not that I agree that is. These things are difficult. If you had told me that I would be an owner of Pelotontoday, I'm not sure I would .  Peloton spent the COVID bubble completely overbuilding and pushing as far away as possible . They overbuilt all of their fitness gear, which is very low margin, as opposed to their subscription business . The people who were intent on empire building are gone .  Peloton was down 99% at one point, but has beaten and raised its guidance each time . The company generated at least 75 million in free cash flow in the last three quarters .  After three quarters, Peloton has done 211 million in free cash flow, not what people were expecting from the corps of Peloton . After two quarters, again, bumped guidance up, and cash flow became at least 200 million for the year . Have 1.5 billion in debt, and some of it's very expensive debt, but they're going to pay it off fairly quickly .  Ricky Mulvey: ""I think Peloton not only can be a multi-bagger from here or here being six dollars when I was looking at it fairly recently. I think you could see a world in less than five years where Peloton goes from six 25 to 30. I'm more interested in that kind of a turnaround, where the bombing happened, and it's just rubble everywhere, rather than at a Boeing, at a Nike, at an Intel .  Motley Fool Chief Investment Officer Andy Cross and senior analyst Asit Sharma interviewed the CEO of PubMatic Rajeev Goel . They talk about ad buyers shift to streaming and what investors need to know about this ad seller's future revenue growth .  Instacartdata, for instance, is available on our platform . If a marketer wants to target people that are shopping for specific products, or maybe it's a conquest where you say, ""If they boughtCampbell'ssoup, then we want to show them an ad for the alternative"" Rajeev Goel: The advertising market is not just growing, but as you mentioned, really evolving toward more programmatic spend .  Asit Sharma: More and more, this targeting is moving to the sale side of the ecosystem rather than the buy side . We can extend the value of that data. outside of Instacart itself. We can bring all of these pieces together to enable a customer to vary efficiently with a high degree of performance .  In your last earnings call, you mentioned a shift in marketing funnels from top of the funnel activities to lower level activities . Rajeev Goel: There's no doubt that there's a degree of uncertainty out there, US trade policy, tariffs, all that kind of stuff that is causing some unease . The good news is that advertising always comes back bigger and better, and in particular, digital .  Advertising has been around for hundreds of years, and it's not going away . What typically happens is the underlying shifts that were happening slowly in the ecosystem, those get accelerated . I think we're going to see a more pronounced shift of dollars from linear TV into streaming .  Spot tends to be much more heavily programmatic dominated, and so we think that's a big upside potential for us . CFO is now getting into the CMOs here and saying, ""Hey, we got to make sure every dollar of ad spend is super accountable""  A lot of advanced data like people logged in. closed-loop reporting, the ability to measure what kind of sales happened . I think we're going, in a good position, to be able to manage through that shift for publishers to drive more performance ad spend . The third is more supply path optimization.  Asit Sharma: Usually, what happens in a macrocycle is people are much more willing to try new solutions . I think we're going to see an acceleration of interest and trial, a lot of these new AI solutions .  Rajeev Goel: I'm happy to share what I can in terms of forward-looking projections . Let me give a little bit of context on the business just from the last couple of quarters . In May of 2024, so almost exactly exactly a year ago, one of our large DSP buyers made a technical change to how they bid . That was a significant headwind for us. The same time, we saw a nice tailwind in political ad spend .  In the second half of last year, that underlying business grew 17% on a year-over-year basis, pretty good . That growth accelerated in Q1 to 21%, so we're seeing a really nice trajectory in the business . We are really targeting to grow at over 15% per year on a sustained basis .  John Mackey: ""I think that 15 ish percent is a good number. 15% plus rate. I think there will be quarters where we're above that"" Mackey says the market is growing in the 8-10 percent range .

" Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a new online child safety bill .

Utah passed a similar law earlier this year, while federal lawmakers have introduced a federal bill to debate the merits of such .  Metapublished a proposal that app stores should be responsible for checking user ages at the app download stage . That would take the onus off of social apps in having to implement their own age-checking and verification processes, which currently see each platform undertaking variable approaches to such . Apple and Google, of course, don't want that responsibility .  Apple has been able to use its lobbying power to dilute restrictions on social media access to users over 16 years old . But with Mark Zuckerberg and Meta actively lobbying regional governments, the momentum may be shifting .  Meta's age checking processes are also being trialed, including video selfies verified by third-parties .

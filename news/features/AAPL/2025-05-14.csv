" Google investors would be better off breaking up most or all of Google’s business, analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance . US District Judge Amit Mehta found Google liable for illegally monopolizing the general search engine market and the market for general search .  Analyst: Google should break up YouTube, Search, Google Cloud, Waymo, and AI segments . Luria: Google's individual businesses would be valued much more highly as separate entities . Google's market capitalization is below $2 trillion .  Luria estimates that Google’s chip segment and Google DeepMind AI would together be worth $760 billion . Luria says the stock could be worth anywhere between $240 and $300 if the company followed its path .  Luria said Google Search is “a melting ice cube.” Some argue Apple testified that it saw a drop in Safari searches in order to present Google Search as a threatened business in hopes of preserving its $20 billion deal with the company .  Luria: ""Only founders [Sergey] Brin and Larry Page can save shareholders"" He said activist investors couldn't force a change at Google because it ""isn't a type of company that an activist could get involved in because insiders have controlling stakes""",negative,"google, investors, market, stock, shareholders"

The news sent shockwaves through the tech sector . In the latest episode of the All-In Podcast, the podcast was recorded on Thursday .  Palihapitiya urged Google to assume a significant share erosion, potentially dropping to 75% within two years .

" Motley Fool host Dylan Lewis and analysts Tim Beyers and Bill Mann discuss the Fed's continued wait-and-see approach to tariff policy, inflation, and interest rate cuts . Two stocks worth watching:AppleandIbotta. HowUberandDoorDashare both flourishing as they cash in on the delivery market and consumer laziness .  If you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $318,970! Now is the best time to buy before it’s too late . Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, available when you joinStock Advisor .  This week, we have a showdown in the food delivery market . We're going to be checking in on Warren Buffett's last Berkshire meeting as CEO . The Fed feels like they're in a pretty comfortable spot .  There's an awful lot of confusion, and some of that confusion is being brought about by an administration that really seems to love chaos more than anything else . The end result for that chaos, they're hoping is lower costs for federal debt .  US and UK reaching early terms on trade and tariffs this week . Most goods from the UK coming into the US will face a 10% tariff . Tim Beyers: Can this affect the Fed policy and what they want to do with rates?  Deal in the US UK deal is doing a lot of heavy lifting there, says Dylan Lewis . Dylan Lewis: What we're trying to do is just curry favor. Create allies. There is some wisdom to that. It might be a deal. It could become a deal .  Dylan Lewis: Everything that you see has to do with statecraft and what is happening between the U.S. and China . Dylan: It's just you've got to keep your eye on what the ultimate goal is here .  The market seems to be responding somewhat calmly, I would say, and I think that has to do with the fact that there is either a recognition or a hope that something will get done there that will take the pressure off of a company like Ford . Dylan Lewis: You're already seeing some recognition of the damage that is going to come .  Tim Beyers: For companies in your portfolio, the management team's behind them, what are you looking to hear? He says he wants clarity and transparency as much as humanly possible . Beyers says Nvidia and AMD have written off chips that were designed to sell into the Chinese market .  Mercado Libre, one of my biggest holdings, is up 17% in foreign exchange revenue this year . Management teams need to be transparent about what they think they can do, says Tim Stanley . Mercado is one of his favorites in that zone .  Mercado Libre was up 40% on a foreign exchange neutral basis . Total items sold 492.2 million total transaction, total payment volume, 58.3 billion . That's up 72% . Mercado is becoming a provider of credit for consumer markets where they operate .  Fundrises Flagship Fund, a 1.1 billion dollar real estate portfolio with more than 4,000 single family homes in the Sunbelt communities, 3.3 million square feet of in demand . Dylan Lewis: Mercado Libre is good at this. They know how to deal with the various machinations of the markets that they are in .  The Flagship Fund taps into some of real estate's most attractive qualities, long term appreciation potential, a hedge against inflation, and diversification beyond the stock market . Visit fundrise.com/fool to explore the portfolio, check out historical returns, and see just how much easier investing in real estate can be .  DoorDash has decided to spend 5.1 billion of its 5.8 billion in cash and investment, short term investments on acquisitions . Tim Beyers: On the surface, this looked like a pretty good quarter. Revenue was up, good free cash flow, good business .  DoorDash is a digital business, not subject to tariffs in the traditional sense, but still very much subject to the macro environment and input costs . Dylan Lewis: It might be an opportunity with a stock down like this, Dylan .  Uber Eats was the category that led for Uber up 22% in constant currency just EBIDA, which I know adjusted terrible. It's a bogus metric, but this business is getting stronger. Tim Beyers: I have to say, Dylan, they have been on a roll for a while now, and this is a scale business, but they're another one .  DoorDash did 23 billion in orders in the most recent quarter, Uber did 20 billion in delivery bookings . Dylan Lewis: A couple of years ago, if you were to ask me, I would have said inevitable that Uber takes over the space .  Tim Beyers: We need to give just some credit to the paradigm shift that's happened here . Bill Mann: I think from here, you've got the duopoly in the US. I think that's really what you've seen more than anything else. I'll confess something that I use DoorDash for?  Shares of Novo Nordisk down more than 50% from highs . Bill Mann: Semaglutide is their cash cow . The Inflation Reduction Act in the US is coming down .  Last year, Amazon was the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, meaning that all of our energy comes from wind farms like this one . Up next, we've got the scene from Omaha from a Fool that was on the ground for Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting .  Warren Buffett officially passes the torch to Greg Abel . Jason Hall: ""Momentous thing was not the two pounds that I've gained since getting home eating See's Candy""  Buffett has long said that he likes businesses that a ham sandwich could run . The Fool was there with us, was smart enough to have his earbuds in and listening to the live stream on his phone .  The decentralization of the operators of those businesses is built into the business, and that certainly simplifies the process . The other thing, too is, too, this has been in the works for more than a decade .  Market was down about 5%, but it was not a huge sell-off for Berkshire shares . People knew that at some point this was coming, and the market seems happy with Greg Abel as the named replacement .  Jason Hall: Buffett has become the Greg Maddox of quips . He might not have the fastball, but he can still locate a pitch like nobody you've ever seen . Dylan Lewis: That is an all-time favorite Buffett quote .  The other quote that really stood out to me was, we are very patient when we are looking at opportunities and we want to act quickly . Never underestimate the amount of reading and work that is being done to be prepared to act . Nobody but Tim could have developed it like it has .  Apple's Tim Cook is probably one of the most successful succession stories of the last 20 years, says Jason Hall . There's something that Greg Abel has in common with a lot of other operators running some of the subsidiaries at Berkshire, he says . Buffett wrote about the founder of Forest River in the annual report this year .  Abel sold his stake in MidAmerican Energy to Berkshire Hathaway a couple of years ago . Abel is emblematic of how important that is to the culture of leadership, not just at the corporate office, but going down to the subsidiary levels as well . There's a lot of operating businesses, about 190 by my account, that will make getting bigger a little bit tougher .  More than half of Berkshire Hath Hath Hathway's operating businesses have earnings declined from the prior year in 2024 . This isn't a recession proof business, but it's very resilient because they're well run and they have that incredible balance sheet .  Berkshire hasn't bought any of its own stock, almost and it's been five quarters now . Dylan Lewis: They're happy to get their 4% yield and just keep waiting until the bigger fish are biting . Jason Hall: Buffett is stepping down as CEO at the end of the year .  I expect they're going to have to wheel him out. I really do. I think once he's just the chairman, that happens, guess who decides about the dividend, the board, not the management . Dylan Lewis: If you could snap your fingers and create a large holding for Berkshire in a business that's publicly traded, what business would it be? Jason Hall:  Apple was one of the best-performing Berkshire stocks for a long time . Maybe there should be a little bit more tech in the portfolio, Jason Hall says . Maybe look at some big software companies. like AdobeorAutodesk.  The Motley Fool's Jason Hall: You are better than me, and you make me better. You're better than you are because you are going to go in the direction of the people that you are associated with . We've got Tim Beyers and Bill Mann back with the stocks on their radar this week .  This is the podcast version of this week's show on the Motley Fool . Check out our show notes. Listen to the show from Dylan Lewis and Bill Mann .  Warren Buffett is 94 years of age, and we sensed last year that he was slowing down . Berkshire has always described that cash as a weapon to be deployed during opportune times .  Tim Beyers: I think that decision about the cash is going to be over in 30 seconds . Bill Mann: I completely respect the fact that they are still leaving that on the table for future times when it's more ideal .  Dan Boyd: I don't know that people have really focused on the implications of the court finding with Spotify that is taking away potentially a pretty big extremely profitable cash flow stream for Apple . I think that that's something that people are going to want to pay attention to in upcoming months .  Tim Beyers: My radar stock here, Dylan, is Ibotta. This is a cash redemptions business. You have an app, scan a receipt, and on that receipt, if there are offers, so say like you have bought . Dan Boyd:I don't have any Apple products here at home, except for the ones that the Fool has given me, so I think that tracks, yes .  Ibotta is different and better and interesting to me. They have huge distribution deals. Walmart's a big one from about a year ago. About three months ago, they just got Instacart. What this means is that if anybody is trying to win the Shelf Space War, you were increasingly shopping on apps or shopping on the computer .  Ibotta is an app that's subject to the Apple tax and the commissions that come in via the App store . Tim Beyers: If those go down, I have to think that that is good news for IbottA shareholders, Tim . Dylan Lewis: Dan Boyd: I'm just going to go Ibota because it's fun to say and really, that's all that matters .

" Virtual reality (VR) isn’t just a gamer’s fantasy anymore . Its market hit $53 billion in 2024, forecasts project a surge to $557 billion by 2034 . Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META) are positioning themselves as VR's vanguard . Drawing from their latest earnings calls, commentary, and market developments, let's dissect their VR-focused investment cases .  Nvidia's Omniverse platform powers the high-fidelity rendering VR demands, from gaming to industrial simulations . The unique thing about Nvidia is that its strength lies in its indirect exposure . Supplying chips and software to VR developers sidesteps the consumer headset market’s volatility .  Apple's $3,500 “spatial computing” device, the Vision Pro, didn’t initially perform well . CEO Tim Cook emphasized Apple’s VR traction with enterprises, citing use cases like virtual surgical training and architectural design .  Meta’s Quest headsets dominate consumer VR, but its Reality Labs division is a cash black hole . In its Q1 results, Meta revealed a $4.2 billion loss on $412 million in revenue, down 6% year-over-year . CEO Mark Zuckerberg called 2025 “pivotal,” touting features like real-time translation and tripling sales of Ray-Ban Meta glasses as steps toward a VR-infused future .  Meta Platforms is currently covered by 44 analysts on Wall Street, with a deeply bullish consensus . META stock carries a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 41 Buys, two Holds, and just one Sell rating over the past three months . VR breaks the mold as the next wave in entertainment, tearing down the limits of flat screens and passive watching .  As investment arrives from major tech companies and consumer interest increases, VR is certainly going mainstream . Nvidia is the low-risk VR play powering the ecosystem without headset exposure . Apple’s Vision Pro is a premium, patient bet, with transformative potential but minimal short-term impact . Meta's Quest leadership comes with steep losses but should offer the most significant upside .",neutral,"vr, nvidia, virtual, gaming, nvda"

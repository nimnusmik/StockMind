" Apple is considering using AI technology from Anthropic PBC or OpenAI to power a new version of Siri . The iPhone maker has talked with both companies about using their large language models for Siri . It has asked them to train versions of their models that could run on Apple’s cloud infrastructure for testing .  The company currently powers most of its AI features with homegrown technology that it calls Apple Foundation Models . A switch to Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI’s ChatGPT models for Siri would be an acknowledgment that the company is struggling to compete in generative AI .  The project to evaluate external models was started by Siri chief Mike Rockwell and software engineering head Craig Federighi . They were given oversight of Siri after the duties were removed from the command of John Giannandrea, the company’s AI chief .  Anthropic's technology is most promising for Siri’s needs, people said . The Siri assistant has fallen behind popular AI chatbots . Apple's attempts to upgrade the software have been stymied by engineering snags and delays .  Apple has already approved a multibillion dollar budget for 2026 for running its own models via the cloud but its plans for beyond that remain murky . Executives have grown increasingly open to the idea that embracing outside technology is the key to a near-term turnaround .  Apple considered acquiring Perplexity in order to bolster its AI work, Bloomberg has reported . The company is working on a series of projects, including a tabletop robot and glasses that will make heavy use of AI .  Meta Platforms Inc. and OpenAI are offering some of the AI industry’s most in-demand talent . Apple is known to pay its AI engineers half of what they can get on the open market .  The iPhone maker requested a custom version of Claude and ChatGPT that could run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers . Apple believes that running the models on its own chips housed in Apple-controlled cloud servers will better safeguard user privacy .  Apple is opening up the on-device models to third-party developers later this year . The company hasn't announced plans to give apps access to the cloud models . The cloud servers don’t have the capacity to handle a flood of new features .  Apple and Anthropic have disagreed over preliminary financial terms . The AI startup is seeking a multibillion-dollar annual fee that increases sharply each year . The struggle to reach a deal has left Apple contemplating working with OpenAI .  Apple killed the project — announced last year as Swift Assist — about a month ago . The company later this year is rolling out a new Xcode that can tap into third-party programming models . App developers can choose from ChatGPT or Claude .",neutral,"siri, ai, apple, iphone, chatbots"
" The Treasury market posted its best monthly performance since February . The benchmark 10-year note's yield fell below 4.24% to the lowest level since May 2 . A Bloomberg index of the debt posted a monthly return of 0.9% through Friday on wagers the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates .  The outlook has helped push US government bonds to their best first-half stretch in five years . While trade negotiations remain in the spotlight, some of the other pressures have eased as the month ends . Investors have become increasingly confident about at least two rate cuts by year-end .  Investors who earlier this month saw the chance of a July rate cut as negligible are now pricing in nearly 1-in-5 odds for a reduction . Goldman Sachs economists said they expect a Fed rate cut in September, versus December previously .  The Bloomberg Treasury index rebalances at 4 p.m. and typically is accompanied by surges in futures volume . Asset managers favor owning Treasuries in the five-year maturity range that would benefit from an eventual bigger Treasury rally extending into 2026 .  The June employment report is forecast to show growth in the workforce easing to about 110,000 new jobs from 139,000 the prior month . The unemployment rate is seen nudging up to 4.3%, and while still contained, would mark a fresh peak since 2021 . A softer report would be a different story for the Fed .  Expectations for Fed rate cuts this year have waxed and waned since December . But policymakers’ median forecast — which didn’t change in March and June — was that the band would decline to 3.75% to 4% by the end of the year, implying two quarter-point cuts .  Investors are alert to the prospect that the Fed ends up being behind the curve by waiting for a clearer view on the economy . The jobs market is a lagging indicator, a point not lost on bond traders . The Fed can ease sooner and deliver their forecast of at least two quarter-point cuts should hard data in the form inflation or job creation significantly weaken .  Disagreements among Fed officials increases a chance for a policy mistake, says TCW Group's Jamie Patton . Patton favors two- and five-year notes, which would benefit from a scenario where the Fed eases more than expected .  SNAP Cuts in Big Tax Bill will hit a lot of Trump voters too .

" Apple lost its bid to throw out an antitrust case brought by the Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general . The lawsuit is an existential threat to Apple and could upend its highly lucrative mobile hardware business . The iPhone maker is accused of violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices .  The ruling tees up years of litigation . Apple says it will ""vigorously fight"" the lawsuit . The judge says allegations about Apple's intent to monopolize the smartphone market are strong enough .  Apple could still seek to settle the case — filed in March 2024 — with the Trump administration . The Justice Department’s new antitrust head, Gail Slater, said at her confirmation hearing that she plans to largely continue the strict enforcement of her predecessors .  The Justice Department and the states argue that Apple’s conduct was a deliberate attempt to box out rivals and build an illegal “moat” around the iPhone . The DOJ says the case is not about Apple refusing to do business with rivals .  Cuts in big tax bill will hit a lot of Trump voters too .

Amazon stock could rise in value over the next few years and make it the most valuable company in the world .

Alphabet's increased focus on designing and utilizing its own AI chips could help power growth for its cloud infrastructure business . OpenAI recently announced that it was renting processing use of the company's tensor processing units (TPUs) through Google Cloud for AI inference applications .  Alphabet's long-term opportunity in the autonomous vehicle space also appears very far from being priced into its valuation . Through its Waymo subsidiary, the company currently occupies a leading position in the robotaxi and driverless-vehicle market .

" Prime MinisterMark Carneyfeebly capitulated to PresidentDonald Trump on Sunday night by rescinding Monday’s scheduled imposition of a retroactivedigital services tax . The DST would seize three per cent of the revenue generated in Canada by large online service providers, including Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and X .  Canada should have been strategic and used the DST as part of a broader trade discussion rather than play the card early and have it shredded . In the end, it is an indirect tax on Canadian individuals and businesses . The government underestimated the likelihood of an aggressive U.S. response .  The Bloc Québécois was able to pass, on unanimous consent, Bill C-202, which freezes tariff quantities and rates . The beneficiaries of SM are about 10,000 dairy farmers, mainly in Quebec and Ontario, who own quotas and form an extremely powerful lobbying group that no political party has been prepared to oppose .  Mark Carney has the opportunity to make the case for change, provided he can muster the political courage . He has already promised a couple of other major policy reversals, although he still has to deliver on both . In 2000, they disbanded SM, compensating farmers with a temporary tax on milk, as a result, milk prices declined .  Oliver: Most of the public supports pipelines to tidewater and exporting oil and gas to overseas markets . Global warming is another striking example of Canadians changing their minds almost instantly in response to external events .

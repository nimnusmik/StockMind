" Apple may be planning to change its iPhone release schedule drastically . The change could significantly impact when you can buy your next preferred model of the iPhone . It could also provide Apple with several key advantages in an increasingly competitive smartphone landscape .  Apple will launch a new iPhone family of entry-level and premium phones in unison in the fall . Instead, Apple will move to a biannual iPhone release schedule in 2026 . You can still expect to see Apple launch the new iPhone 17 family in full this fall .  Starting in 2026, Apple will launch the premium iPhone 18 series models, including the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Slim/Air, along with a new foldable iPhone 18 in the fall . The entry-level iPhone 18 and budget iPhone 18e won’t be released until approximately six months later, in the spring of 2027 .  Apple is facing intense competition in China, Kuo says . Many smartphone manufacturers now release phones in China in the first half of the year, this leaves Apple at a disadvantage . By moving the iPhone’s entry-level and budget “e” versions .  The strategy may also encourage consumers who want the latest iPhone to upgrade to the premium model instead of waiting another six months for the entry-level model to be released . Delaying the less expensive models by six months may compel some consumers to opt for the pricier premium ones instead, ultimately benefiting Apple’s bottom line .  Currently, Apple’s manufacturing partners around the world must bring on tens of thousands of workersevery summer to assemble iPhones for the fall launch . Bottlenecks can easily occur in the manufacturing chain if enough workers aren’t available . If Apple staggers its iPhone rollout throughout the year, Chinese manufacturers may not need to staff up at the levels traditionally required .  2025 is probably the last year that Apple will launch the full family of the newest iPhones simultaneously . The move does make a lot of sense for the company from both a marketing and financial perspective .",neutral,"iphone, iphones, smartphone, apple, phones"

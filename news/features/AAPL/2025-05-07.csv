Non-farm payrolls came in well ahead of expectations at 177,000 for April .  We haven't seen the effects yet of tariffs that have gone into effect this week . As the weeks wind on into this new quarter, I believe we're going to see some shelves that have fewer products . We'll see now hikes on prices of big ticket items, maybe even some smaller ticket items .  Nearly a quarter of Americans, 24%, are scrapping plans to make significant purchases, like a home or a car as of today . Another 32% say they're putting big-ticket purchases on hold . Ricky Mulvey: Jason Moser: ""I think those data points are all very clear""  When it comes to recessionary times, we associate recessions with bear markets, and that's very fair because typically we see market underperformance during recessions, obviously . A flip side to that is, it's like we make most of our money during bear markets . We just don't know it at the time, that Old Shelby Davis saw. It is very difficult to go through it as an investor .  Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in the latest earnings report, ""When there are uncertain environments, customers tend to choose the provider they trust most"" Ricky Mulvey: These are the times when you really want to be keeping an eye out there for a lot of those great businesses that perhaps can be going on sale, so to speak .  CEO Andy Jassy also pointed out that Amazon mostly sells goods at a lower price point, including some $100 billion of groceries annually . He's got a point there, Amazon is this big machine for substituting goods. They can get stronger. Amazon is a platform business on the e-commerce side .  Amazon Web Services just continues to be this juggernaut . Management really wasn't that worried about tariffs . Overall, this was a very decent quarter for Amazon . I see some near-term trouble ahead for Amazon that might last a quarter or two .  Most of that operating income is coming from Amazon Web Services . Operating income in total up by more than 20% from a year ago . Ricky Mulvey: Amazon has a pretty solid business that can get stronger in this environment .  Ricky Mulvey: Meta is telling investors a story with AI and glasses, and Apple is using $100 billion to buy back stock . We'll talk about that after the break .  The overall message from Zuck seemed to be, AI is going to sell Meta users more stuff and keep you on those platforms for longer . Jason Moser: Ricky, what happened to the word Metaverse?  Meta is basically there with its AI aspirations, but certainly a good corner of the market received it very well . Revenue of $412 million, that was actually down, but this thing is still chalking up massive losses . $4.2 billion in operating losses just for the quarter .  Facebook Inc. raised guidance on their CapEx spend for the full year to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion . That's up from 60-65 billion just a quarter ago . Clearly, they are spending a lot of money, but it feels like it's the right investment .  Microsoft Cloud's revenue was up 20% to 42.4 billion . Asit Sharma: Investors really liked that Microsoft's Cloud revenue is still going very strong with all the uncertainty that investors have to worry about across the investment landscape .  Total revenue for Microsoft is $70 billion. That's an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter . Net income also increased very nicely, about $26 billion. tied to AI initiatives.

Apple has done a very good job over the last several years, trying to diversify their supply chain, and they're making big investments in India . Ricky Mulvey: I was actually really impressed with iPad revenue that was up 15% from a year ago . But I think as with most companies, right, the conversation revolves around tariffs and how companies are dealing with these .  Asit Sharma: Apple, Amazon, Microsoft make up about 20% of the whole market cap of the S&P 500 . Jason Moser: These are the times when the strong gets stronger, and so they're the ones that are going to be able to weather the storm . Ricky Mulvey: Up next, we're going on a trip, a look at the travel industry .  Universal Epic Universe is the first major new theme park to come to Orlando in more than 25 years . The park has five separate lands, SuperNintendoworld, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, the Ministry of Magic . Rick Munarriz: ""I've never seen a park that looks this good before it opens""  The Ministry of Magic Ride is down more often than it's up, but everything else is beautiful . The details are great. The ecosystem is there for all these restaurants, very different restaurants. There's a hotel literally in the back of the park where you can walk in .  Universal Studios has a lot of advanced animatronics on display at the park . Rick Munarriz: Universal Studios is not just about rides and roller coasters, but it's also about animatronic creatures .  Rick Munarriz: This is really a next level experience that I think once they get all the bugs worked out, it's going to be very popular, and popular for the tourism industry in general . Mary Long: It's one thing to go to a theme park like this and to experience it as a guest .  Epic Universe is not selling annual passes at all at Epic Universe . Instead, you have to pay 140, 150, $160 for a day at the park instead of spending 500, 600, $700 for an annual pass . They are going to be making a lot of money at this park .  Theme parks are almost a quarter to a third of Disney's business . Theme parks for Comcast is basically 6, 7% of the revenue mix in the last couple of quarters . Comcast is not a very exciting company. Trade's at a low multiple.  The timing of this park opening comes at what feels like a bit of a precarious time for the travel industry . Mary Long: For Comcast, they're putting more interest into it now . Unlike its cable business or even broadband connectivity, it has a good chance to keep growing rather than declining in the years to come .  US hotels to grow by only shy of half of a percent this year this year . Rick Munnariz: International travel is going to be iffy while there's course of international trade war going around .  Hilton's earnings for the first quarter came in at $300 million . That's up over 13% from the year before . Mary Long: It seems that there are some travel companies that are maybe bucking this trend . Long: People, too, consumer, the residential business folks like me and my family .  Rick Munnariz: ""I don't know if they cracked the code, but they are gaining market share"" Mary Long: ""If people aren't going to be traveling, it's not as if Hilton has this lock where they'll never let people check out, like Hotel California or anything like that""  Rick Munnariz: The moral of the story is that rising tides does not lift all ship cruise line stocks . Royal Caribbean, the stock is up 63% over the past year .  Royal Caribbean is a company that has historically grown faster than Norwegian Cruise Lines has produced better margins . Norwegian Cruise had to be fair of the decline . Part of it was that some of their large ships were in dry dock .  Rick Munnariz: ""I would say yes, but mostly no. one company and Norwegian Cruise Line. There is a difference. To me, I don't have to fly to the major ports. All three of the major cruise lines have ports""  Royal Caribbean said that their cancellation rate for this last quarter was no different than it was before . But when we get to later in the year, the economy does have to play along because even though a lot of the people that go on cruises, they may be older .

" PLAYSTUDIOS first-quarter 2025 earnings call . Company will make forward-looking statements during the call . This conference is being recorded as a result of the conference .  We will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call . These measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP . These statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs .  Market conditions across traditional social casino and casual segments remain challenging, and this continues to weigh on our operating performance . The social casino category is being impacted by the rising popularity of sweepstakes styles offerings, which are capturing increasing mind share and spend .  We expect to make the service available to select players in Q2 and begin scaling in the back half of the year . Our vision is to reclaim sweepstakes for what it was intended to be a fun, engaging and trusted promotional incentive that will drive more consumption across our social casino portfolio .  Social casino portfolio continues to face category-wide headwinds with softness across all key casino apps . monetization improved across several core titles . ARPDAU increased year-over-year in POP! Slots, myKONAMI and especially in the myVEGAS franchise .  In Q1, our direct-to-consumer channel generated approximately $5 million in in-app purchase revenue, representing 9.8% of total IAP revenue . This compares to $2.3 million or 3.9% in Q1 of 2024 and $4.7 million in Q4 of 2024 .  Tetris Prime also experienced challenges with user acquisition continuing to be the primary headwind . While monetization per user held relatively steady, growing the audience remains difficult in an increasingly competitive market .  PlayAWARDS platform is working closely with our games to elevate the role of our rewarded play model . We've now executed the full integration of myVIP across our major games to drive a more unified loyalty experience . While purchases and redemptions were down double digits, this reflects our deliberate strategy to focus on premium, high-quality rewards .  Daily average retail value of available rewards increased by 5% to approximately $2 million per day . Second annual $1 million myVIP World tournament of Slots hosted by Atlantis Paradise Island, Bahamas, taking place from October 22 to October 26, 2025 .  First quarter revenue was $63 million, down approximately 19% year-over-year, reflecting continued softness in both our social casino and casual portfolios . Revenue was also down approximately 7.5% sequentially from the fourth quarter as a result of seasonal softness and continued DAU pressure .  DAU was $2.6 million, down 25% versus Q1 of '24 and down 3% sequentially . MAU was down 23% year-over-year and largely flat sequentially, reflecting recent stabilization .

We repurchased $1.6 million of our stock in the quarter under our existing share repurchase authorization, which has $42 million remaining at quarter end .  Andrew Pascal: We're making steady progress. We're investing in our future while improving profitability . Our investments in the sweepstakes, promotional mechanic and Tetris are taking shape, and we're excited about the path ahead .  Start to introduce and slowly scale the sweeps offering in the back half of this quarter, the second quarter . We have already done some limited amount of technical validation, and we're just continuing to evolve the product and make sure that all of the internal control standards and operating practices are solid and in place .  You're getting a lot of success there, doubling year-over-year to $5 million . It's now 10% of your virtual currency sales. I guess just remind us what's driving your success or your growth there? And if you think momentum can continue.  The Apple and Epic case will make that even easier because we now have the ability to route purchases through the direct channel more directly, and we can promote and deep link and do a lot more interesting things to make the process more frictionless for the consumer . We haven't fully modeled what that means in terms of new contribution by the end of the year .  In the development phase, can you kind of talk about maybe what's changed since you started going after this and kind of your learnings from the initial testing? Andrew Pascal: ""I don't know that there's anything that we've learned. It's really more just validating the overall technical stability and performance of the platform that we built""  Apple-Epic Games lawsuit is still developing and Apple, I think, is appealing . Andrew Pascal: We think, number one, it's going to expand the adoption of users that convert over to direct purchases .  Andrew Pascal: We think this could enable a more strategic evolution because it enables deeper loyalty tie-ins. because we don't have to pay the 30% cut on those specific purchases. So that's kind of a near-term very practical and kind of technical benefits that we would assume. But over time, we think we could do some interesting things strategically .  Players of our sweeps offerings and promotions will not only be able to engage in the games and accumulate promotional currency that can ultimately be converted to cash . As they engage with our products and accumulate those benefits, they'll also continue to accumulate loyalty currency and all the real-world benefits .  Andrew Pascal: We've done a lot over the last couple of quarters to really kind of reset our rewards offering . We want to make sure they all fit kind of our entertainment and leisure positioning of the program .  Andrew Pascal: We're going to do all we can to take advantage of this shift in Apple's overall position in response to the ruling . There are a lot of different ways to implement alternative means of purchase that reduce the amount of friction and make it easy for the players .  Can you confirm that your EBITDA target does not or have, in fact, included the investments for new game launches, including sweepsteak and Block Party?  Jason Hahn did not believe we have specific UA costs related to Block Party .

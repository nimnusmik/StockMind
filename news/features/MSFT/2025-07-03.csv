" Microsoft is trading at all-time highs and nearly 40 times its trailing earnings . It's one of the most highly valued stocks on the market today, trailing only Nvidia . The business has many growth opportunities and has been a big player in artificial intelligence .

" In this episode of ETF Spotlight, I speak with Tim Rotolo, Founder and CEO of Range Fund Holdings, about investing in the nuclear renaissance . President Trump’s recent executive orders on nuclear power outline a sweeping agenda to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050 . The renewed interest in nuclear energy is largely fueled by Big Tech's push into the sector, as AI data centers require massive amounts of energy .  Building nuclear power plants is notoriously expensive and time-consuming . SMRs are typically manufactured in factories and can reduce construction time and costs . Nuclear fusion is often called the ""holy grail"" of energy because it promises a virtually limitless, clean, and safe source of power by replicating the process that fuels the stars .

" Many investors shy away from “defensive” stocks like mobile providers because they don’t offer the potential for huge gains . But these are the very stocks that investors turn to during recessionsor market sell-offs precisely because of their stocks .  When big tech stocks are dropping 40%, 50% or even more, it can panic even the most steadfast of investors . To remain in the market, money often flows to stocks like Verizon and AT&T, which may drop only a little bit or perhaps even rise when momentum stocks are crashing . The reason these types of stocks tend to hold up during recessions is their services are always needed .  Verizon and AT&T are exceptionally cheap, with price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 10.41 and 17.63 . Both stocks also offer well-above-average dividend yields, making them attractive to income investors . Verizon has an 18-year track record of raising dividends .

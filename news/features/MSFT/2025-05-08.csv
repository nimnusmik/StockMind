" Artificial intelligence has been an epic catalyst for the likes of Nvidia and many of its big tech peers . Amazon has witnessed a near-trillion-dollar surge in its own valuation during the AI revolution . While Nvidia has a higher market cap than Amazon today, the e-commerce giant could leapfrog its semiconductor counterpart the end of the decade .  Amazon reports its revenue across six major categories: e-commerce, physical stores, third-party seller services, advertising, subscriptions, and Amazon Web Services . While AI has the potential to disrupt all of Amazon's operational segments, AWS and retail are the two that have me most encouraged . I think the company could be worth much more than semiconductor giant by next decade .  Amazon is outfitting its fulfillment centers with robotic processes that can bring a new level of automation and efficiency to packaging and shipping services . Amazon should be able to reduce labor costs over time, resulting in greater profitability for its core retail operation .  Amazon is in the early phases of developing its own AI chips . Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabetare pursuing similar ambitions . While I don't think this will be catastrophic for Nvidia, it likely won't help it in the long run . Investors might want to prepare for less robust growth in Nvidia's sales and profits .  Amazon appears to be in the early stages of taking advantage of new opportunities for accelerated growth . Amazon's valuation trends suggest that investors are not yet placing much of a premium at all on the company's efficiency improvements or long-run potential .

" Scott Lauber; President, Chief Executive Officer, Director; Xia Liu; Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President; WEC Energy Group Inc. Xia Liu . Brian Russo; Analyst; Jefferies LLC Andrew Weisel; Scotia Capital (USA), Inc. A replay will be available two hours after the conclusion of this call .  Scott Lauber, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group, will discuss our results for the first quarter of 2025 . Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor .  We're off to a solid start to the year . We're on track to deliver another year of strong results in line with our 2025 earnings guidance . We continue to target 5% to 7% long-term compound annual growth rate .  Cloverleaf has announced plans to develop approximately 1,700 acres for another large data center campus . Eli Lilly has announced a $3 billion [expansion] of its manufacturing facility in Wisconsin . Uline announced another expansion in Southeast Wisconsin .  On the tariff front, we're evaluating the impacts of tariffs on our supply chain and capital plan . For our $28 billion capital plan, we estimate the tariff exposure is approximately 2% to 3% overall . As you can expect, we are actively engaged to mitigate efforts .  The Wisconsin Public Service Commission has approved our purchase of 90% of the high noon solar and battery project for approximately $883 million . The Harden 3 solar project has a total capacity of 250 megawatts . Construction is expected to be completed in 2027 .  The proposed very large customer, or VLC tariff, would meet the needs of our very large load customers while protecting all of our other customers . The terms of the agreements are 20 years for wind and solar and the depreciable lays for natural gas and battery storage assets .  The Illinois Comverse Commission lifted the pause on our work and directed Peoples Gas to focus on replacing all cast iron and ductile iron pipe that is a diameter under 36 inches by January 1, 2035 . The Commission also directed its staff to appoint a safety monitor to provide oversight by July of this year .  First quarter 2025 earnings of $2.27 per share reflects a $0.30 increase compared to the first quarter of 2024 . Weather positively impacted quarter-over-quarter earnings by approximately $0 .18 . We are currently developing engineering plans to execute the order to replace some of our mid-1800s pipe some dating back to the mid 1800s .  The Wisconsin rate review outcome that was effective on January 1, 2025. contributed $0.20 more to earnings. Tax and other items added another $0 .04. These positive drivers were partially offset by O&M expense, depreciation and amortization . And let me give you some color on our weather-normal retail electric deliveries .  At American Transmission Company, earnings increased $0.02 compared to the first quarter of '24 . Earnings from the Corporate and Other segment decreased . This was driven by higher interest expense .  We expect to raise a total of $700 million to $800 million of common equity in 2025 via our ATM program as well as the dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans . This is a part of the $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion total common equity we expect to issue through 2029 . We are reaffirming our 2025 earnings guidance of $5.27 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year .  This marks the 22nd consecutive year that our shareholders will be rewarded with higher dividends . Overall, we're optimistic about continued growth in our region and our company's growth and future .  Overall, we were long on one company and a little bit short on the other, but nothing material, all in the right direction . We build (technical difficulty) several years now as we get orders in place to build new generation capacity .  We are looking at and we have successfully tested gas at about 30% blend on the power of the future coal units, and we're looking to our plans to make that 100% gas by 2029 . And the same thing looking at the Weston 4 units, converting it to gas .  Scott Lauber: We expect that will probably be a little over $500 million a year going forward . We'll see the program ramp up in '26 and '27 and get to what we think will be a full run rate, and we're still pulling the numbers together in '28 .  Microsoft reiterated to us that the economic development and the demand that we have in our forecast over the five-year period, that supports that Southeastern Wisconsin that 1.8 gigawatts is still solid .  Andrew Weisel: I have no concerns that that site is still going to be very, very strong and a very core part of Microsoft's development. worked with them on building substation ourselves American transmission company, and that work progresses.  Xia Liu: We're targeting $700 million to $800 million. We're managing it very, very tightly, but we feel very confident that through our ATM and the employee benefit plans, we could access the $700 . million fairly easily throughout the rest of the year. The IRA has been in focus for the market for some time in tax credit transferability as well .  A lot of our customers are anticipated to remember, all the PTCs and ITCs for the projects going forward go back to our customers . Transferability, there's other ways to look at moving those tax benefits to others, whether it's tax equity or transferability .  On the phaseout point, like Scott mentioned, we're actively seeking safe harboring the upcoming renewable projects . We have been able to transfer about $200 million of PTCs annually to third parties . As we build more projects, that number ramps up slightly in the plan .  Xia Liu: If transferability were to only impact projects put in service from 2026 or 2027 or later, we would have very limited credits that we would not be able to sell . So we think the impact would be pretty limited .  Scott Lauber: I think the key is you hit it. We worked with our very large customers with the basic understanding that we cannot have this very large load gets subsidized at all by any other customers. So we worked on the fundamentals, and that's how we came up on the tariff. I think it's a fair tariff for our customers, for the very . large customers and for our shareholders. So I'm very happy with it.  Last year, last year was such a warm first quarter. So the growth, I think, is just getting back to normal weather. I'm happy to see normal. think our team did a great job and really appreciate both sides as we balance it through with the large customers and our internal team. So I'm really optimistic with it.  Just you gave some acreage and maybe projected about a 1 gigawatt of demand . Just curious, would that mostly be met with gas or a combination of gas and renewables or any type of clarity you can provide on the generation needs there .  The timing of when maybe that load would come online, that would something we get more on the third quarter call? Scott Lauber correct. And they're trying to get that purchaser in the next couple of months, and then we'll have more clarity as we work with them to develop their plans .  A lot of the electric and gas distribution is mainly domestically sourced, Scott Lauber said . The solar for the near-term projects, if we're very comfortable, those are in flight . The farther ones out, of course, we have been working with other developers and suppliers to really onshore a lot of of the production of these panels .  The challenge, of course, is where do you get the polysilicon and the wafers, the cells, et cetera. So we've been working with everyone to get that . If there would be a cost increase, we would notify our regulators, the commission as soon as possible of that cost increase .  The biggest potential charges coming from the tariffs could relate to batteries or the solar projects . of the very large customers, we could see them looking at renewables and batteries too as they look at PCAs and long-term generation needs .  I don't think it's going to be that big of effect, but Xia Liu, any additional color? Xia Liu says the lower the corporate tax rate, you would collect less from the customer . So everything else being equal, there will be slightly less cash flow for the company overall .  Scott Lauber: Most of the customers are cautious on what's going on with the tariffs . So I think people are cautious before they overreact one way or the other. So unemployment was constant at 3.2%.  10 of the 16 sectors had quarter-over-quarter positive growth, some with double-digit growth . There's still a lot of expansion in housing development in Southeastern Wisconsin. way below the national average .  Scott Lauber: ""I haven't seen anything that has gone one way or the other. I think everyone is looking at the economic development and what's needed for gas"" Carly Davenport: ""We remain very optimistic about the long-term growth in our region""  Scott Lauber, a lot of eyes on the tariff filing in Wisconsin, the VLT filing . Maybe just a little bit cutter on the higher ROE, how do you come up with 70 basis points higher than the current authorized . Just any color or thoughts there would be really appreciated .  In Illinois, the higher $500 million per year rate which you get to in '27, '28, that is not going to be recovered by a tracker, correct? Scott Lauber correct. That's slide 1. And if not, what's the rate case strategy on under covering that higher level of spending .  It will be more of an ongoing annual rate case in the future. on site to actually review our projects too as they go in. So I think it adds a lot of color and a . lot of opportunities to improve the prudency on a front-end basis also as we go through these capital projects .",neutral,"wec, tariffs, tariff, renewables, renewable"
" Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia have the most realistic chance of reaching the $4 trillion club first . Microsoft is racing to fill a $315 billion order backlog from customers who need more computing capacity for their artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions . Nvidia might be much further away from the mark, but it could legitimately achieve the milestone .  Since 2019, Microsoft invested around $14 billion in AI start-up OpenAI . Microsoft combined OpenAI's latest AI models with its own to create the Copilot virtual assistant . Copilot is now integrated into the company's flagship software products like Windows, Bing, and Edge, for free . It's available for subscribers of the 365 productivity suite for an additional monthly fee .  Microsoft said there were hundreds of thousands of organizations using Copilot for 365 around the world . CEO Satya Nadella said a record number of customers opted to buy more licenses during the quarter . The company rolled out new Copilot features to encourage more subscribers to upgrade .  Microsoft accounts for its AI cloud revenue under its Azure AI segment . Azure AI accounted for a record-high 16 percentage points (almost half) of that figure . The company opened new data centers in 10 countries in the third quarter alone .  Microsoft allocated $21.4 billion to capital expenditures (capex) during the third quarter, most of which went toward data center infrastructure . Microsoft is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.6 as of this writing . It's sitting roughly between Apple stock, which trades at a P/E ratio of 31.9 and Nvidia stock .  Microsoft is growing its EPS below trend at the moment, partly because of its enormous data center spending which is weighing on its profitability .

" Apple cautioned investors that steep import tariffs will take a toll on profits beginning this quarter . iPhone sales remain lethargic, with last quarter’s measurable growth mostly rooted in unusual circumstances . Tariffs are arguably the least of Apple's problems right now, if you dig deeper into its historical results .  Apple turned $95.4 billion in revenue into earnings of $1.65 per share in fiscal Q3 . The iPhone accounted for roughly half of Apple's business, with sales of $46.8 billion . The company's services arm continues to shine as well .  iPhone unit sales of the iPhone improved 10% year over year, but that's a 10% improvement on a figure that fell by nearly as much in the comparable quarter a year earlier . Actual iPhone revenue remains more or less in line with where it peaked in 2022 .  The iPhone accounts for half of Apple's sales, and presumably, a comparable percentage of its profits . Without this push, it's conceivable that last quarter's iPhone business might have actually fallen . Apple didn't embrace this next generation of AI chatbots in earnest until last year .  Apple's AI chief has been removed as head of Siri's ongoing development . Tim Cook was forced to concede during the recent earnings call that the implementation of a new-and-improved Siri is ""just taking a bit longer than we thought"" Apple is usually isolationist, and such a decision confirms just how far behind its AI efforts .  Apple is steering customers to its competitors on AI-powered virtual assistants . Does this spell doom? Hardly . If nothing else, Apple remains the world's most profitable company .  The bottom line? Apple isn't necessarily a sell here . There's even a wobbly case for stepping into the stock while it's down more than 20% from its December peak .

Trump's initial tariff plan was put on pause to offer countries time to negotiate trade deals with the U.S. The president has temporarily exempted electronics products from the tariffs . It's too early to determine this impact, since final tariff levels haven't been set . The tech giants all face a certain degree of impact on future earnings prospects .

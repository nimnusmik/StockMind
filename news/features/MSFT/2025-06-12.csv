Rough estimate suggests the value of a year of time for 1,130 civil servants could be in the order of around £50m .  Microsoft 365 Copilot isn’t free, nor included in any existing enterprise subscription . At the time of writing, the annual list price is an additional £277.20 per user . The usual annual cost for 20,000 civil servants would normally be just over £5.5m . For the whole civil service it would be around £140m .  None of that £50m value in the trial is a cashable saving .

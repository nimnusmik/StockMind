" Bill Gates' net worth topped $100 billion in 1999, 18 years before anyone else would reach that level . The Gates Foundation manages a trust with a publicly traded portfolio valued at $45 billion . While Gates made his fortune in tech, most of the stocks held by the trust are surprisingly non-tech . Gates' investment strategy is heavily influenced by longtime friend and Gates Foundation trustee Warren Buffett .  Gates seeded the foundation with $5 billion worth of Microsoft stock in 2000 . He's donated even more since then . Microsoft has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of growing artificial intelligence spending .  Microsoft says it remains capacity-constrained on its AI compute, despite spending heavily to meet demand . Roughly half of that growth was driven by AI services . Microsoft's enterprise software also benefits from AI, as Microsoft continues to improve its Copilot software .  Gates has been friends with Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett for a long time . Gates served on Berkshire's board of directors from 2004 to 2020, and Buffett served as a trustee for the Gates Foundation from 2006 to 2021 . Gates Foundation held just over 17 million shares worth roughly $8.7 billion as of this writing .  Holding onto a good chunk of Berkshire Hathaway shares has worked out well for the foundation . The diversified holding company has seen its value soar as its stock portfolio has performed well . Buffett has strategically sold off many of Berkshire's largest public equity holdings as valuations grew more and more expensive .  Waste Management is one of the longest held stocks for the Gates Foundation trust fund . As of the end of March, the trust held just over 32 million shares worth about $7.5 billion . Waste Management's biggest advantage is its dominant landfill position .  Management expects to extract $250 million in synergies from Stericycle, now WM Healthcare Solutions . For now, the acquisition is weighing slightly on Waste Management's operating margin, which fell 2 percentage points year over year to 27.7%. That's due to just 12.3% margins for the new healthcare unit, and a slight contraction for the legacy business . The margins should return closer to 30% as Waste Management realizes those synergies and grows the business .  The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years .

Flutter Entertainment(NYSE: FLUT),Docusign(NASDAQ: DOCU), andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE) Manufacturing(TSM) were the biggest bets . Taiwan Semiconductors stock started in green but finished the quarter significantly lower .  Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) has recovered from low points in early March thanks to first-quarter results that beat Wall Street expectations . First-quarter revenue soared 41.6% year over year . On the bottom line, earnings per share shot 60% higher .  Flutter Entertainment owns the popular FanDuel brand, which grew monthly users by 11% year over year to 4.3 million at the end of March . Its U.S. iGaming business grew first-quarter revenue by 32% to $472 million . The company launched a cross-promotion that has already lifted monthly iGaming users above 1 million .  At a value of $87.5 million, Docusign was the 10th largest position in the portfolio at the end of March . Sales growth has decelerated since the pandemic, but revenue is still moving in the right direction . Subscriptions were responsible for 97% of first-quarter revenue, which grew 7% year over year .

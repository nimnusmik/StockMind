The company successfully increased engagement on its suite of social media websites and apps by utilizing AI-powered algorithms . As advertisers are increasingly seeking it out to place ads in front of their target audiences .  Meta Platforms' current market capitalization is $1.6 trillion . It needs to record a compound annual growth rate of 13.4% in the next five years to become a $3 trillion company .

" Apple was the largest company by market cap for more than a decade but recently was dethroned by Microsoft and Nvidia . The company is growing sales much slower than Nvidia or Microsoft . Apple's slow growth and risks to its earnings mean it will likely not regain its market cap leadership position .  Microsoft and Nvidia are benefiting immensely from AI and its impact on demand for cloud computing and semiconductor products . Apple has failed to capture any share of these rapidly growing sectors, which is why these other ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are charging ahead of it in market capitalization .  Microsoft and Nvidia have grown EPS at a much faster pace than Apple while Apple's EPS has barely budged in the last few years . Apple may see its EPS fall over the next few years because of its high-margin services and software revenue is under attack from antitrust lawsuits .  I think it is unlikely that Apple will reclaim its throne atop the market cap leaderboard . It has minimal growth avenues to drive revenue higher while a company like Nvidia is posting 69% year-over-year revenue growth in its latest quarterly results . Apple is a risky stock to buy right now .  Netflix could produce monster returns in the coming years .

" The S&P 500 has been in a technical bull market since October 2022 . The current bull market has produced a total return of 65% in the last two and a half years . Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks like Palantir, Nvidia, and Meta Platforms have been major drivers of this bull market .  Investors who haven't owned some of the biggest names in the AI space have probably underperformed the index by a wide margin . The Roundhill Generative AI and Technology ETF holds a concentrated portfolio of the world's top AI stocks . Investors can buy a single share in the ETF for under $50 .  The AI industry is still in its infancy so the list of quality companies in those three segments is very short . Nvidia supplies the world's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers . The company delivered a record $39.1 billion in data center revenue, which was up 73% year over year .  Palantir has a market capitalization of $288 billion as of this writing . It's headed to a $1 trillion valuation over the next two or three years . Demand has soared for its AI software platforms like Gotham, Foundry, and AIP .  The Roundhill ETF doesn't have a very long track record because it was only established in May 2023 . It's up by 68% over that period, which is much better than the 40% gain in the S&P 500 index in the same period . With that said, investors are paying a premium for that outperformance .  Nvidia has previously said data center operators could earn $5 over four years for every $1 they invest in the company's chips by renting the computing capacity to AI developers in the cloud . If that's true, companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Oracle, and Amazon could be poised for significant growth .  The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years . Consider when Netflixmade this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $651,049! The Motley Fool’s total average return is 979% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to171% for the S&P 500 .

" Investors' latest obsession is the TACO trade, which stands for ""Trump always chickens out"" The strategy is based on a pattern surrounding President Trump's tariff rhetoric over the last few months . History suggests investing in the S&P 500 remains lucrative as the trade continues to unfold .  A new market strategy has been making the rounds on Wall Street as well: the ""TACO"" trade . TACO is an acronym that stands for ""Trump always chickens out"" A clear pattern emerges every time Trump announces new tariffs and subsequently pulls back on these policies .  The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides passive exposure to the stock market's biggest companies . It's the largest of its kind with over $650 billion in assets under management . The fund is weighted by market cap, meaning giants like Nvidia,Microsoft,Apple,Berkshire Hathaway, and Eli Lilly contribute more to the fund's performance .  The big takeaway here is that despite economic slowdowns, the S&P 500 has remained quite resilient . Stock prices generally rise over long time horizons, and investing in the S.P 500 remains a simple, winning strategy .

" President Trump recently signed an executive order aimed at giving the nuclear energy industry a boost . President wants to overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and speed up the development of new nuclear power reactors in the country . NuScale Power, Constellation Energy and Cameco stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as nuclear energy stocks that could benefit from the industry's renaissance .  NuScale Power's price advance is being driven by emotions, since the company doesn't technically have a product to sell just yet . Small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) are a very exciting advance in nuclear power . SMRs are built in a factory, which makes them cheaper, easier, and quicker to build than large, site-built nuclear power plants .  A lot has to go right for NuScale Power before it has a sustainably profitable business . The nuclear renaissance could lead to material long-term gains for early investors in this growth stock .  Constellation signed a deal with Microsoft last year to support the restart of its Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant . Microsoft signed a 20-year contract for all the power produced from this nuclear plant when it comes back online in 2028 . Constellation is investing in other cleaner energy sources, like renewables and natural gas .  Cameco is on track to grow its adjusted operating earnings at a more than 13% compound annual rate through 2030 . It can grow even faster if it closes its Calpine deal . The nuclear resurgence could power additional growth over the longer term .  Cameco estimated that nearly 70% of the total estimated uranium fuel requirements of nuclear reactors worldwide through 2045 remain uncovered . Cameco owns a 49% stake in Westinghouse Electric, which supplies nuclear technology and equipment for nuclear reactors .

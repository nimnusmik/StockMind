" Microsoft pulled the plug on planned data centers in Ohiolast month and a Wells Fargo report suggested Amazon wasreconsidering some leases . The question isn’t whether AI infrastructure demand is real — it’s whether the real estate market and power grid can handle it .  75% to 85% of new data center capacity through 2029 is already pre-leased, says Andy Cvengros .

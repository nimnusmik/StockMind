" The big winner of the first phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has clearly been Nvidia . As competition heats up in the AI chips market, cloud services providers could benefit . As the AI revolution rolls on, other companies may supplant Nvidia .  In 2022, Nvidia generated about $27 billion in revenue . As of its most recent quarter, the company reported $130 billion . That's shockingly fast growth, and it's often cited for why Nvidia's share price has risen 800% .  As the market for AI chips becomes more saturated, who will benefit? My investing instincts point to one of the big buyers of AI chips . Amazon, through its Amazon Web Services division, controls around 30% of the cloud services market . Amazon's market share is roughly equal to Microsoft's combined AI chip market share .  Next phase of AI revolution could see the focus shift away from AI infrastructure (GPUs) and toward practical AI . Amazon stock, with its leading position in that key market, could ultimately outperform Nvidia stock in the long term . The cloud infrastructure market is enormous (ataround $700 billion) and red-hot, growing at around 15% year over year .

Oklo went public in May 2024 via a merger with AltC Acquisition Corp., aSPACled by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman .  Oklo's goal of reimagining nuclear power has piqued Wall Street's imagination .

Oklo's reactor design is modeled after the government's EBR-II, a liquid-metal-cooled, metal-fueled fast reactor .  A unique aspect of Oklo's go-to-market strategy is its build-own-operate model . Unlike traditional nuclear vendors that sell reactors to utilities, Okla plans to build, own, and operate its microreactors . Oklo plans to sell electricity directly to customers via long-term power-purchase agreements .  Oklo isn't just building reactors. It's building a vertically integrated nuclear ecosystem -- from power generation to isotope production .

" OpenAI is racing against time to restructure its business . Microsoft has invested $10 billion in OpenAI in 2023 . The cloud computing giant has exclusive access to OpenAI’s application programming interfaces (APIs) and models on Azure .  Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its AI cloud services, generated $105 billion of the company’s $245 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2024 . The two companies are at loggerheads over the terms of a new deal .  OpenAI is looking to block Microsoft from accessing technology from its $3 billion acquisition of AI coding tool Windsurf . Another major issue is how much equity Microsoft would have in OpenAI’s restructured business .  Microsoft has given up exclusivity for OpenAI to use its Azure cloud services . Microsoft now has the right of first refusal for the company . OpenAI began in 2015 as a nonprofit under the name OpenAI Inc., a nod to its mission of advancing humanity .  OpenAI had hoped to shed its nonprofit status to attract additional investors and renegotiate with existing ones . The move would have detached it from its legal responsibility to carry out its original organizational purpose: to ""advance digital intelligence in a way that is most likely to benefit humanity"" The company was estimated at $300 billion in its latest funding round in March .  Musk is seeking to block OpenAI from converting to a for-profit business . That suit is already set for trial .

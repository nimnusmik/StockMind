" A lucrative tax break that sports team owners can use to shelter billions of dollars of income would be halved in value . The tax break came under fire after a ProPublica investigation based on leaked returns showed the shelter helped billionaire team owners pay lower effective tax rates than their players or concession stand workers .  Trump has a tortured history with sports team ownership that includes failed attempts to acquire the Buffalo Bills and then-Baltimore Colts football teams . The House Budget Committee on Friday failed to advance the legislation over hard-line conservatives’ cost concerns . The tax bill itself is the subject of heated negotiations going into the weekend .  Some sports accountants and lobbyists greeted the scaled-back House GOP provision with a “bit of a sigh of relief” given the White House’s efforts to eliminate it completely . Owners also dodged other risks such as curbing tax-exempt bonds to finance stadium build-outs, he said .  The tax shelter allows owners active in operating the sports franchises to reduce their taxable income depreciation-like write-offs of “intangible assets” Those include so-called “goodwill” aspects like a team’s reputation, strong brand recognition such as a logo and other intellectual rights, radio and television rights, and fan loyalty and following .  The ability to amortize costs assigned to those items over a 15-year period has been one of the main tax shelter-draws to owning sports teams for wealthy people or billionaires . Private equity firms are increasingly being involved in sports franchise ownership .  There will always be something to be said about being part of an exclusive country club of, say, 32 NFL owners, Drew said . “Even if certain tax breaks are no longer there,” Drew said. “There will always been people wanting to buy.”",negative,"bills, nfl, tax, sports, franchise"

Super Micro Computer has thin margins because it does not provide the most value for the AI sector . This comes from Nvidia's innovative computer chips, which it can sell at a premium price, and the cloud infrastructure providers selling computing power to software companies . A cyclical downturn will eventually arrive in data center spending will lead to declining profit margins for Super Micro .  This is a cyclical company with no long-term competitive advantage in its industry . Investors would be smart to avoid buying shares of Super Micro Computer .

Nvidia has been the biggest winner from AI spending so far, but the second-order effects of the trend could be even bigger .  Nvidia has been a huge beneficiary over the last few years from the massive artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending by the hyperscalers . Its cutting-edge GPUs (graphics processing units) are unparalleled when it comes to training large language models in the most cost-efficient manner . Nvidia is selling its chips just as fast as they're manufactured .  Meta looks best positioned to take advantage of everything large language models and generative AI can do . Meta has been a big investor in artificial intelligence for a long time . It'll just take some time for the company to fully realize the impact of AI on its business .  Meta used to require advertisers to select a target audience for their ad creatives . Generative AI has the potential to unlock a ton of value for Meta's business . As a result, there's more emphasis on the ad creative .  Meta stands to benefit from building several different types of AI agents . Mark Zuckerberg: ""Our goal is to make it so that any business can basically tell us what objective they're trying to achieve ... and then we just do the rest""  Meta could benefit from developing customer service agents and sales agents for its messaging apps . That could enable businesses to deepen their relationships with prospective and existing customers without spending significantly on overhead . Eventually, Meta could use AI to generate bespoke content for each user .  Meta could create an endless feed of hyper-specific personalized content . AI-generated ad campaigns become just as personalized and even indistinguishable from entertainment in Meta's feeds . The company has already seen success with integrating Meta AI into a pair of glasses .  Meta Platforms is well positioned to own that format with its 10-year head start . Zuckerberg envisions AI generating unique content for users on Facebook and Instagram . That's the type of content that could push AR and VR headsets forward .

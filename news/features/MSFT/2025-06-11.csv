" IBM is building the first large-scale quantum computer capable of operating without errors . The computer, called Starling, is set to launch by 2029 . IBM stock hit an all-time high of $273.27 on Monday, more than the S&P 500's roughly 12% gain .  IBM’s Starling is a “significant” development for the quantum computing market, IDC quantum analyst Heather West said . Once developed, useful quantum computers would solve problems that would take “classical” computers billions of years .  IBM says Starling will be able to run large-scale quantum operations without error . Unlike traditional computers that use bits or series of 1s and 0s, quantum machines use qubits . Qubits are a function of quantum mechanics and, rather than being expressed as a 1 or 0, can exist as both at the same time, allowing for far more processing capabilities .  IBM will use a code called qLDPC requiring its quantum computers to use fewer qubits . The company says this will allow it to scale the computers without making them less accurate . Google also said it achieved this feat with its Willow chip in late 2024 .  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in January that useful quantum computing was decades away . Horvath expects “useful’s quantum computers will arrive within the next five years . Tech CEOs have previously projected longer timelines .",positive,"qubits, ibm, computing, computers, starling"

The tech giant is deep into its efforts to develop quantum technology . Microsoft could benefit by creating and selling quantum computing technology, as well as by deploying it throughout its existing services .  Investors won't get rich overnight with Microsoft, which already has a staggering $3.5 trillion market cap . Analysts estimate that Microsoft will grow its earnings by 15% annually over the next three to five years . Microsoft is an outstanding do-it-all blue chip technology stock to buy and hold for exposure to quantum computing .  IBM has arguably built a solid foundation for the future as a hybrid cloud solutions company with expertise in AI and quantum technology . IBM yields a solid 2.5% at its current price, and management has raised the dividend for 29 consecutive years . Experts believe practical quantum computers may still be five to 10 years away .

" The S&P 500 has averaged annual gains of roughly 10% over the past 15 years . That's enough to quintuple an investment over 15 years for those who purchased exchange-traded funds . Some individual stocks, though, have done better than that -- much better .  Nvidia, Intuitive Surgical and Microsoft are three companies with outsized growth potential . Nvidia got its start as a maker of semiconductor chips for the videogame industry, but it has expanded its scope in the past decade . Microsoft is turning out gobs of chips for data centers -- enough to be the world's world's biggest chip maker .  Data centers have replaced gaming as Nvidia's focus, and the company raked in $39 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026's first quarter . CEO Jensen Huang forecasts that AI infrastructure spending could top $1trillionannually within a few years . Consider buying Nvidia to hold for the next 10 years or more to take advantage of this forecasted growth .  Intuitive Surgical is a leader in robotic surgery equipment . It has more than 8,600 of its million-dollar-plus da Vinci robotic surgery systems installed in 71 countries . Microsoft is a tech giant with many growing operations contributing to its steady growth .  Microsoft is still growing at a fairly rapid clip, with some of its recent growth largely attributable to its AI-related ventures . The company is generating more cash than it needs to spend on growth, so it's paying shareholders a dividend that recently yielded 0.71% .

" AI-driven large language models gobble information in a race to dominate the web’s frontier . The latest of the AI scraping wars is between Reddit and AI startupAnthropic . Reddit claims that Anthropic intentionally scraped Reddit users' personal data without their consent .  Anthropic is also defending itself against a separate suit from music publishers . The case adds to a growing number of high-profile cases where copyright holders have tried to guard their works from the reach of technology firms .  The court rejected Ross's argument that it could use the summaries under the concept offair use, which allows copyrights to be used for news reporting, teaching, research, criticism, and commentary . The New York Times (NYT) filed a lawsuit accusing OpenAI and Microsoft of illegally using millions of published stories to train OpenAI’s language models .  Getty Images is trying to chip away at the same argument in lawsuits filed in 2023 against AI image generation startup Stability . Stability argues that fair use justified training its technology on copyrighted material .  In 2005, the Authors Guild sued Google over millions of books that the tech giant scanned and made available in “snippets” to online searchers . Google didn’t pay for the copyrighted information but did provide word-for-word pieces of the copyrighted works in search results . The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reasoned in adecision that Google’s scanning project tested the limits of fair use but was “transformative” and therefore protected under fair use law .  Google could be drawn into the new AI scraping wars as part of a landmark antitrust case against Google’s Search monopoly that was won last year by the US Justice Department . The DOJ has argued that the search giant could further entrench its dominance by training its AI model, Gemini, on its vast index of internet content .",negative,"copyrights, lawsuits, copyright, lawsuit, sued"
" The $3 trillion stock club isn't a big list; it's just Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple . Amazon is the fourth-largest company in the world, but it is currently valued at around $2.2 trillion . Apple lacks the growth to outperform Nvidia or Microsoft .  The bulk of Nvidia's revenue comes from its data center graphics processing units (GPUs), which have been widely deployed to train and run AI models . Nvidia has a dominant hold on this market, with most estimates stating that Nvidia's market share is greater than 90% .  Next quarter also looks promising for Nvidia, with revenue expected to rise 50% year over year . Part of this slowdown can be attributed to the U.S. government banning exports to China of its H20 chip . Demand for Nvidia's products is expected to persist, with data center buildouts expected to reach $1 trillion by 2028 .  Apple is barely growing and hasn't showcased the ability to release an innovative product for some time . Despite this, it still doesn't trade at much of a discount to the other two from a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio standpoint . With theS&P 500 trading at 22.4 times forward earnings, Apple could have a long way to fall before trading at that level .

" Shares of electric vehicle manufacturerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)have dropped by 21% on the year . While Tesla's core EV business continues to struggle, I think shares are poised for an epic comeback . A bullish narrative surrounding robotaxi has fueled some recent excitement in Tesla stock as of late .  Tesla investors understand that Elon Musk's vision for the company is not just to sell the most EVs . Musk has been focusing on various elements of artificial intelligence (AI) and how the technology can be used to transform Tesla . Right now, the most immediate AI use case for Tesla is commercializing autonomous driving software .  Among Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, these three cloud computing giants are forecast to spend nearly $260 billion in AIcapital expenditures just this year . Investors might want to see some tangible return on investment in the form of accelerating revenue and widening profit margins .  The primary catalyst fueling Tesla stock right now seems to be the robotaxi launch . At its core, the company's self-driving technology is a software product -- meaning it carries higher profit margins than the traditional automobile business .  Tesla stock has steadily been climbing over the last month-and-a-half . But I would caution investors from buying into the idea that now is an opportunity to take advantage of a dip . Musk himself has made it explicitly clear that the robotaxi will not be a meaningful financial contributor for Tesla for at least a year .  Tesla stock will outperform its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers over the next six months . But I actually think investing in the stock is a bit risky at the moment . A more prudent approach to an investment in Tesla is to see how the Robotaxi business scalers in the coming months while learning how impactful this new segment is for the entire business .

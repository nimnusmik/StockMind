" Quantum computing is an incredibly promising technology that could unlock new ways to solve some of the world's most complex problems . Multiple companies are investing heavily in this arms race, and businesses of all sizes are vying for quantum computing supremacy . Alphabet kicked off the quantum computing investment trend with the announcement of its Willow quantum computing chip .  Traditional computing transmits information in bits, either a 0 or a 1, so traditional computing isn't prone to errors . Quantum computing utilizes qubits, which transmit information as the probability of an answer being 0 or 1 . On the downside, there is room for errors to develop because the answer isn't explicitly a 0 . Google's solution was to arrange the qubits in a grid-like pattern to reduce the errors each qubit has .  One of the more popular pure-play investments in the quantum computing arms race is IonQ . IonQ relies on external contracts to fund the company, which it realizes as revenue . For both Microsoft and Alphabet, $7.5 million is a rounding error, and they can afford to throw more resources at quantum computing .  This is a key factor in the AI arms race: The big tech giants can outspend the start-ups . While David and Goliath stories exist for a reason, with how much research and intense computing power are needed to get quantum computing to a usable point, I want to invest in the bigger players .

" Quantum computing is an incredibly promising technology that could unlock new ways to solve some of the world's most complex problems . Multiple companies are investing heavily in this arms race, and businesses of all sizes are vying for quantum computing supremacy . Alphabet kicked off the quantum computing investment trend with the announcement of its Willow quantum computing chip .  Traditional computing transmits information in bits, either a 0 or a 1, so traditional computing isn't prone to errors . Quantum computing utilizes qubits, which transmit information as the probability of an answer being 0 or 1 . On the downside, there is room for errors to develop because the answer isn't explicitly a 0 . Google's solution was to arrange the qubits in a grid-like pattern to reduce the errors each qubit has .  One of the more popular pure-play investments in the quantum computing arms race is IonQ . IonQ relies on external contracts to fund the company, which it realizes as revenue . For both Microsoft and Alphabet, $7.5 million is a rounding error, and they can afford to throw more resources at quantum computing .  This is a key factor in the AI arms race: The big tech giants can outspend the start-ups . While David and Goliath stories exist for a reason, with how much research and intense computing power are needed to get quantum computing to a usable point, I want to invest in the bigger players . As another benefit, they still have a strong base business to lean on if either of these two loses the quantum computing arms race .

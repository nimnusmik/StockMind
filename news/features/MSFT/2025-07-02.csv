" The U.S. Senate rejects moratorium on state-level AI laws . Meta unveils its new AI organization . Microsoft says AI can out diagnose doctors…and Anthropic shows why you shouldn’t let an AI agent run your business .  Professional services firms seem to be finding a return on their AI investment at a higher rate than in other sectors . Thomson Reuters found it was the professional firms where AI usage was part of a well-defined strategy and that had implemented AI governance structures were the most likely to see gains .  Businesses enact high-minded ‘Responsible AI’ principles but then the teams building or deploying AI products struggle to operationalize them . This gap means that teams building AI applications may not have visibility into the data used to train a model they are deploying or detailed information about how it may perform .  Is everyone in the business aligned about why AI is being used in the first place? Is it for human augmentation or automation? Is the goal to be more accurate than a human, or simply to come close to human performance at a lower cost? What role should environmental sustainability play in these decisions?  KPMG had a policy of not deploying AI in situations that called for human judgment . Auditing is full of such cases, such as deciding on materiality thresholds . Many corporate legal departments are embracing AI faster than legal firms .  Corporate counsel are demanding that external lawyers be more transparent about their AI usage . Many legal tasks can now be done in far fewer billable hours . AI is also possibly going to change how professional service firms think about career paths within their business .  The National Center for State Courts in the U.S. said that if large law firms had trouble attracting and retaining AI expertise, the situation was far worse for governments . Judges and juries are increasingly being asked to rule on evidence that might be AI manipulated .

" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a seasoned tech expert, has been quite vocal about his optimism around artificial intelligence . While his liking for Nvidia (NVDA) is well known, it is not the only AI bet that Ives is bullish about . Microsoft (MSFT) is also one of his preferred mega-cap tech stocks .  Even after the severe selloff in tech stocks in April, shares of Microsoft are up 17% on a YTD basis . With a market cap of $3.69 trillion, it is the second-most valuable company in the world . Skeptics may point toward Microsoft’s rich valuations and make a case for not investing in the stock .  Microsoft's services segment saw revenues climb from $44.8 billion a year earlier to $54.7 billion in the current quarter . Meanwhile, earnings advanced by 17.7%, reaching $3.46 per share and surpassing consensus forecasts . Operating cash flow also exhibited robust momentum, rising to $37 billion from approximately $32 billion in previous year .

" Sell-side analysts continue to raise their price targets onMicrosoft Corp (MSFT) stock . MSFT is trading at$492.50, just off its recent peak of $497.45 on June 26 . One way to play this is to sell short out-of-the-money (OTM) MSFT puts . They provide a short-put yield of over 1.3% one month out for a 4% lower strike price .  Microsoft's price target was based on strong free cash flow (FCF) and FCF margins . However, there is reason to upgrade our price target, as analysts have done . Using a 29% FCF margin (the same as its latest quarter) and analysts' next 12-month (NTM) revenue average of $298 million, we forecast$86.42 billionin FCF .  MSFT's market cap, according to Yahoo! Finance, is $3,655 billion . That means MSFT stock is worth 25.55% more, or $618 per share . Since then, analysts have significantly raised their price targets .  MSFT is still deeply undervalued, but there is no guarantee this will occur . The stock could fall from its peak . One way to play this is to set a lower buy-in target by shorting out-of-the-money put options . This also provides existing shareholders with extra income .  The $470.00 strike put has a premium of $6.80 per put option contract shorted . That is slightly over 4% below today's price . The short-put yield is higher than before (for new investors), almost 1.5% higher . For investors who rollover the prior trade, the new yield is still high .  Investors using a mix of these trades can make a 1.5% short-put yield over the next month . The breakeven buy-in point is lower for an investor buying into MSFT if the account is assigned to buy at $470 .  This article was originally published on Barchart.com .

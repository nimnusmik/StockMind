" Investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure is expected to reach nearly $7 trillion by next decade . As demand for data centers, network equipment, and chips continue to rise, so does access to this infrastructure . Nebius Group offers a unique cloud-based solution for AI developers seeking access to high-performance AI training and inferencing .  Nebius operates across four segments . The company's core business is an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) business . Nebius has three subsidiaries: Avride, Toloka, and TripleTen . Avride is emerging force in the autonomous vehicle industry . Toloka serves as data partner for large language models (LLMs) and AI developers .  Nebius is a diversified business positioned to benefit from AI in many different ways . The company works closely with Nvidia, allowing its customers to access a series of different GPU architectures . At the end of the first quarter, Nebius' IaaS business was operating at a $249 million annual recurring revenue run rate .  Nebius appears to have strong secular tailwinds fueling its long-run growth narrative . The company is also building out new infrastructure in Iceland, Kansas City, and New Jersey . Nebius was actually spun out of a Russian internet conglomerate called Yandex .  Nebius is flying under the radar -- completely overshadowed by CoreWeave's popularity . I see robust growth ahead for Nebius both in the short and long run, and I think the company's growth will continue .  Nebius Group's relationships with Nvidia and others in the AI landscape could lead to larger, more strategic deals over time . For these reasons, I would encourage investors looking for new growth opportunities in AI space to consider a position in the infrastructure services pocket .

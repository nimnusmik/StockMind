" President Donald Trump's flurry of artificial intelligence deals during his tour of the Middle East is opening a rift within his own administration . China hawks grow increasingly concerned the projects are putting US national security and economic interests at risk . The Trump team has worked out agreements for parties in Saudi Arabia to acquire tens of thousands of semiconductors .  Some senior administration officials are seeking to slow down the deals over concerns the US hasn’t imposed sufficient guardrails to prevent American chips shipped to the Gulf from benefiting China . China hawks also have grown alarmed over what they see as a willingness by White House AI Adviser David Sacks to entertain proposals from Gulf leaders .  If the deals all come to fruition, the US would still hold the vast majority of the world’s computing power . Gulf countries would for the first time have significant capabilities powered by best-in-class US hardware .  Advocates for the deals argue that if the US doesn’t encourage the world to use American chips, countries with AI ambitions will eventually turn to alternatives from Chinese companies . “The only question you need to ask is: does China wish it had made these deals? Yes of course it does,” Sacks wrote on X.com .  Several senior officials have discussed strategies for slowing implementation of Gulf AI agreements, people say . One concern is a bilateral accord between the US and UAE that could include a massive project by OpenAI .  All AI chip shipments to the Gulf require approval through a licensing process involving several federal agencies . Administration officials are also in the middle of drafting global semiconductor export control rules after tossing out a framework introduced by President Joe Biden .  The UAE and Saudi Arabia offered a combined $2.4 trillion in US investments that helped pave the way for the recent AI . Some officials in both the Trump and Biden administrations have argued that America’s technological lead is quite large and enables Washington to write the rules of the road .  Some senior administration officials have grown wary of negotiating positions adopted by Sacks . Sacks expressed openness to UAE housing a production facility from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The UAE has long coveted such a plant and asked the US government for its support as part of the broader chip accord .  Some US officials remain wary of G42’s commitment to American priorities . G42 agreed to divest from Huawei and other Chinese providers to pave the way for a $1.5 billion partnership with Microsoft . Now the Trump administration is considering an agreement that would allow G42 to buy the equivalent of more than a million Nvidia H100 accelerators .  Sacks has been angling to steer efforts to write the fine print, people say . The US delegation shot down that suggestion in the meeting, but after the fact, Sacks suggested that Trump’s team should evaluate the idea . Saudi officials suggested they may install US chips in facilities that contain Huawei hardware .  Sacks: ""All one would have to do is send someone to a data center and count the server racks to make sure the chips are still there.” The idea is not part of the current accord, people familiar with the matter said .

" AMD is racing to catch up to Nvidia in the market for AI chips for the data center . The company's data center business is a key focus for investors right now . The stock is trading at an attractive valuation following a 47% decline over the past year .  AMD is gearing up to start shipping its MI350 series, which is based on a new architecture called CDNA (Compute DNA) 4 .

The two segments of AMD's business that rely on AI chip sales now account for over 81% of the company's total revenue .  AMD's embedded business delivered $823 million in sales, which represented a decline of 3% from a year ago .

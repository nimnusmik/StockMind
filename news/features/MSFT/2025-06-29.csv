Meta has steadily increased its advertising revenue and profitability .  Nvidia's sky-high operating margins have helped the company convert a substantial amount of revenue into profit . But competition or a slowdown in AI spending may lead to margin erosion over time . Nvidia has transformed its business from relying largely on gaming, professional visualization, cryptocurrency, and other end markets to being a data center-focused business .  Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia all sport surprisingly reasonable valuations . Most of the Magnificent Seven have forward price-to-earnings ratios in the mid-20s to mid-30s . Nvidia's 51.7% profit margin means that it converts over half of every dollar in sales into pure net income .

" Microsoft stock only needs to gain another 8.3% for the company to become the founding member of the $4 trillion club . Microsoft has become a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) thanks to products like Copilot and Azure AI . Investors are paying a premium for Microsoft stock right now .  Copilot is available for free in some of Microsoft's flagship software (like Windows, Edge, and Bing) It's also available as a paid tool in several products, like Word, Excel, PowerPoint . Copilot Studio allows enterprises to create custom AI agents and deploy them into software applications .  Copilot can transcribe conversations between doctors and patients, generate referral letters, and even summarize diagnosis evidence to help improve outcomes . Copilot isn't the only revenue-generating AI product in Microsoft's portfolio because the company operates one of the world's largest cloud computing platforms called Azure .  More than two years ago, Azure AI accounted for just five percentage points of Azure's quarterly revenue growth . Microsoft CFO Amy Hood says the segment has a staggering $315 billion order backlog from AI customers who are waiting for more data center capacity to come online . Microsoft is on track to have spent over $80 billion building AI infrastructure during fiscal 2025 .  Microsoft's fiscal year 2026 begins on July 1, and Wall Street's consensus estimate suggests the company could deliver $15.14 in EPS . That places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 32.6 . That's 14% higher than its five-year average of 33.4, which suggests investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock .  Microsoft only needs a gain of 8.3% for the company's valuation to hit $4 trillion .

" Investors are rewarding big tech companies that are monetizing AI . Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet could be coiled springs for long-term growth . Investors may be souring onTesla,Apple, andAlphabet due to their apparent lack of AI achievements .  Tesla stock popped after its robotaxi event showcased progress on self-driving cars . Tesla could benefit from AI one day, but it isn't monetizing it to a significant extent right now . Apple hasn't made meaningful AI improvements to its product suite .  AI presents arguably the best opportunity in decades for competition to tap into Apple's dominant smartphone market share . Apple has grown increasingly dependent on sales outside the U.S., but has been losing market share in key markets like China due to intense competition from companies like Xiaomi, Huawei, and Vivo .  Alphabet-owned generative AI model Gemini can work with text, audio, visuals, video, and even code . Google Search is facing its biggest challenge in decades from competitors' AI-powered search offerings . The elephant in the room is uncertainty about how AI could affect Google Search .  Tesla is arguably the highest-risk name given its lofty valuation . But Apple and Alphabet both have more reasonable valuations (31.2 P/E for Apple and 18.6 for Alphabet) These companies generate a ton of free cash flow and earnings that they can use to reinvest in the business .  Short-term-minded investors may pass on Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet simply because they aren't proven AI plays . But all three stocks could still be worth buying and holding for long-term investors . Apple and Alphabet present far more compelling risk and potential reward profiles than Tesla .

Out of the 35 covering the stock, 30 are bullish while the remaining five are neutral . The average price target is $519.76, indicating a modest upside of approximately 6% .

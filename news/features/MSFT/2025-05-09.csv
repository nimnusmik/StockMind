" Bill Gates has said he will donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the Gates Foundation . Today, that would be worth an estimated 107 billion dollars (£80.6 billion) The pledge is among the largest philanthropic gifts ever . It outpaces the historic contributions of industrialists such as John D Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie when adjusted for inflation .  Mr Gates says spending down his fortune will help save and improve many lives now . The pledge is “a welcome bit of boldness”, at a time when optimism is in short supply .  The Gates Foundation has long been peerless among foundations, attracting supporters and detractors . It has directed scientific research, helped develop new technologies, and nurtured long-term partnerships with countries and companies .  Foundation’s influence on global health is both a measure of its success and a magnet for criticism . For years, researchers have asked why a wealthy family should have so much sway over how the world improves people's health and responds to crises .",positive,"philanthropic, wealthy, fortune, foundation, billion"
" Bill and Melinda French Gates created the Gates Foundation in 2000 . They had planned for the organization to continue its work, using their remaining fortune, for several decades after they died . But now, Gates says he doesn't want to wait that long to give away most of his wealth . He plans to distribute “virtually all’s’ll be distributed within the next 20 years, he estimates .  The pledge builds on Gates’ track record of promoting philanthropy . The Gates Foundation has already given away more than $100 billion since its founding . Gates has increased the pace of his giving in recent years, especially following the pandemic .  The Gates Foundation will focus on three main goals: ending preventable deaths of moms and babies, eradicating deadly infectious diseases and lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty . Gates accused fellow billionaire Elon Musk of “killing the world’s poorest children” because of his work at the Department of Government Efficiency cutting US international aid programs .  Gates' current net worth is $108 billion; Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index ranks him as the fifth wealthiest person in the world . The $200 billion he expects to give away through the foundation over the next 20 years will come from its existing $77 billion endowment and personal wealth .  The announcement comes weeks after Microsoft marked 50 years since it was founded by Gates . Microsoft is now worth more than $3 trillion .

Brian Krzanich; Tony Rodriguez; Chief Financial Officer; Cerence Inc Daniel Hibshman; Analyst; Craig-Hallum Nicolas Doyle; Needham & Company Mark Delaney; Analyst .  The company may refer to certain non-GAAP measures, key performance indicators, and pro forma financial information during this call . Please refer to today's press release for further details of the definitions, limitations, and uses of those measures .  Brian Krzanich will be presenting at the TD Cowen Technology, Media, & Telecom Conference on May 29 and Evercore ISI Global Automotive Dealer & Supplier Conference on June 10 . Webcast details will be provided soon .  As we anticipated and stated in our last earnings call, we did not see a meaningful impact from tariffs on this quarter's results . For Q3, we believe the impact will remain limited. However, we are seeing some pressure from our customers on pricing and some changes in their program time lines .  Based on what we can see today and on currently available information for fiscal year 2025, we continue to assume minimal impact from tariffs . We're building on that foundation to ramp up on our non-automotive efforts .  We're continuing to identify new verticals where we think we have a solid value proposition and can win . We believe we will see the impact of this work on our revenue and profitability in fiscal year 2026 and beyond .  We continue our work on Cerence XUI, our hybrid AI assistant platform . We reached several important milestones for XUI within the quarter, including the product's market launch . And we continue to evolve and enhance XUI with further edge and multimodal capabilities .  In the coming months, we plan to continue to expand XUI's features and capabilities as well as increased language availability to serve automakers globally . We've signed several deals with top automakers, including JLR and have several more that will close within the coming quarter .  The second key deliverable for 2025 is to continue growing our business with new and existing customers . We continue to build the pipeline for the hybrid cloud embedded aspects of XUI for automakers' future programs .  Q2 revenue of $78 million exceeded the high end of our guidance range of $74 million to $77 million . Gen AI solutions went live with three customers, Hyundai, Kia, and PSA . The third key deliverable for 2025 is to continue our transformation and cost management .  As compared to the prior year, Q2 revenue increased $10.2 million . With Q2 behind us, we expect no material fixed license revenue to be signed during the remainder of the fiscal year . Our gross margin for the quarter, of 77%, also exceeded the high end of our guidance range of 74% to 76% .  Our adjusted EBITDA of $29.5 million exceeded the high end of our guidance range . This decrease of $15.9 million or 32% represents savings from restructuring efforts conducted at the end of last year .  EBITDA loss was $29.8 million better than the approximate $300,000 loss for Q2 of last fiscal year . The improvement in non-GAAP operating expenses over prior year was driven by continued focus on managing operating costs and improving profitability .  Fixed license revenue during the quarter was $21.5 million compared to $10.4 million for Q2 last fiscal year . Q2 Connected Services revenue was $12.6 million, down $1 million or 7% from the same quarter last year . Professional services revenue was down year-over-year by approximately $4.8 million but down a bit more than expected .  Total billings adjusted to exclude professional services, prepaid billings, and prepaid consumption was $224 million . Our pro forma royalties were $39.7 million, which were comparable to Q2 of last fiscal year .  Q2 worldwide car production was down 3% versus the same quarter last year and down 1% quarter-over-quarter . Approximately 11.6 million cars with Cerence technology were shipped in Q2 .  PPU represents the average technology price per vehicle shipped, including both embedded license fee and connected services subscription . 29% of vehicles were connected this quarter compared to 26% a year ago . PPU is influenced by contract pricing, take rate of technology features and adoption rate of connected services .  For Q3, we expect revenue to be in the range of $52 million to $56 million . No material fixed license revenue expected to be signed during the quarter . We are reiterating our revenue guidance for the full fiscal year .  We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $28 million to $34 million . We expect to maintain a cash balance above $70 million for the rest of the fiscal year .  We're happy with our Q2 results and are feeling confident in our outlook for the full year . We remain focused on execution and customer delivery, business process improvement and cost reduction . We look forward to continuing to share our progress with you .  Billings deceleration towards 0%, but connected cars, sort of real nice uptick, acceleration from 5% to 10% . Maybe just puts and takes on the metrics, what are driving those and which of those you see as sort of pointing to the future trajectory?  New Connected revenue is up about $1 million sequentially, which is one of the larger jumps that's taken time to ramp . Daniel Hibshman: Is that fair to say that whatever is ramping there, it would be fair to expect to continue to ramp into Q3, Q4? Or is there anything onetime there?  Connected revenue takes a quarter or two, depending on the vehicle and the geography before we see that revenue, Daniel Hibshman says . AI is going to be showing its head in connected more so than in variable. revenue.  Looking through the rest of the year, what's driving that the most right now? Is that the AI functionality, other functionality getting in, in terms of impacting the PPU? Brian Krzanich: Just sort of what are the drivers -- the key drivers behind Connected -- and what -- if anything you can quantify either qualitatively or quantitatively .  AI is driving usage of the voice in the vehicle across the board, whether it's connected or not . It's able to then translate that to a large language model and do the car function . You can just say, hey, my feet are cold. Hey, could you crack the window? Daniel Hibshman .  Where, if anywhere, would we be seeing that if it was showing its head? Would that be in the IHS units as in just sort of total units shipped in the industry trickling down to you? Brian Krzanich. Does that make sense in terms of how that is a component as well in the edge?  A large number of our cars are shipped outside of the US, it may not be directly correlated to what we'll see . If volumes decrease dramatically, we would be just directly impacted by that . Remember, we ship worldwide. right?  As we've talked about the last -- this quarter and last quarter, we're seeing a little bit of headwind in the PS . But as you mentioned, we did not adjust guidance for the full year, we still think we'll hit that range .  Brian Krzanich: We are up probably a little bit more than our original plan on the connected side . But the other piece is really from the license volume that we're seeing. where is it coming from? It's the tech tech. We're not giving as many discounts, right?  MediaTek and NVIDIA are working together on cores that are directly related to automotive that have the right pricing and go-to-market within the automotive space . So they're building those SoCs. And we're helping them and they're helping us by integrating our software .  NVIDIA and MediaTek working on the SoC and then us working with the combined group there to deliver the software stack. optimize together for performance, right?  What are we trying to achieve? I mean we're protecting our intellectual property, right? We you as a shareholder are investing with us on the development of this technology and text to speech and wake-up word and a lot of those IPs were foundational to Cerence, and we continue to advance those and really drive those .  Tony Rodriguez: We're not going to give guidance on a go-forward basis . Even if there is pricing pressure in the future, what Brian is saying is, hey, if you have more, let say, a take rate on the technology stack or something, we can give that at a discount . But overall, that would still may drive a higher PPU. It could be plus or minus based on those two aspects of a bit of pricing .  At this point, I'm not willing to give any guidance going forward, but again, it's a positive trend over the last trailing 12 months . And remember, we're reporting here an average number, right? So this number is going to incorporate variance over time . And it's -- we're trying to learn ourselves how to use this to look at our operations .  Mark Delaney: Are you seeing Microsoft start to compete more with you and have they moved into the vehicle space? Brian Krzanich: So it's an active lawsuit. I'm just not allowed to talk about much detail beyond this other than it's really about protecting our IP .  The lawsuit is one separate issue. about use of our IP and Cerence getting paid for it. And we're just protecting that, and that's what the suit is about. about . Brian Krzanich .  As the automakers struggle with tariffs and all the disruptions to their new vehicle production business in the last few years, they're looking to shift, as you know, more towards earning revenue from their installed base through various services . I'm wondering if maybe the tariffs could actually increase interest in your go-forward offerings .  We have some really cool proofs of concept and development work going on with our OEMs that is slated to come out, I'll say, like late this year, early next year that starts to use this both in cabin and outside of cabin capability .  Companies are going to have to find an effective way to provide more capability for that price . People aren't just going to accept pricing and price increases, Itay Michaeli says . The good thing is the industry is working well together, he says .  As a follow-up, I was hoping maybe you could expand a bit more on some of the non-automotive opportunities you alluded to before . Brian Krzanich: We're looking for verticals where we can take the software expertise and capabilities and innovation that we already have and apply that to applications that we think consumer demand will be there .  So we're trying to do this very cost effectively, which means we may grow a little slower than we possibly could if we did it guns of blazing, but I think is a smart way to do it . Imagine you're in a mall and rather than trying to find where the lululemon is or the whatever restaurant you want to find is, you just walk up and say, hey, can you point me to the Tommy Bahama Restaurant or whatever .  Itay Michaeli: We're looking at some other verticals, but they're very nascent right now, just making sure understanding does our technology apply, do we think there's real demand for it, things like that . Terrific. where we're starting.",neutral,"tariffs, pricing, 2026, 2025, slated"

Last year's result wasn't a one-off because the Vanguard ETF has outperformed the index every year .  Nvidia is the largest holding in the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF . Nvidia grew its revenue by 114% during its last fiscal year, and its stock more than doubled in both 2023 and 2024 .  Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon just reported their financial results for the first quarter of 2025 . Each company exceeded Wall Street's expectations at the top and bottom line .

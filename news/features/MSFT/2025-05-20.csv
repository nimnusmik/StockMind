" The U.S. and China struck a deal to lower import tariffs significantly from levels that had surpassed 100% . Tech stocks have been center stage as tariff concerns mounted because they heavily rely on manufacturing abroad .  Last week, the U.S. and China reached an initial trade agreement, dropping the level on imports from China to 30% . Now, Ives says the bull case is ""back on the table"" for tech stocks such asApple, Microsoft, andPalantir Technologies .  Apple and other tech companies could benefit from the new tariff agreement . The deal would allow them to continue manufacturing in China without seeing an extreme increase in costs . Ives says the deal is a ""game changer"" for the tech industry as a whole .  The trade deal as it stands won't lead to a significant increase in the prices of imports . That's because the result is less of a weight on consumers' wallets and companies' budgets . This means customers of tech companies may continue to spend on tech companies .  Some tech stocks don't make good investments right now, while others are screaming buys . Apple, Palantir, and Microsoft are well positioned to grow revenue further and excel in the AI space . Even at higher valuations compared with a few weeks ago, these stocks still make solid buys .  The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years .

" S&P 500 Index clawing back into the green for 2025 after being whipsawed by President Donald Trump’s vacillating trade policies . Tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) are still down this year . Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index includes those companies as well as Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  Technology and telecommunications stocks both rose more than 35% to lead the S&P 500’s 23% gain last year . This year, typically lagging groups like industrials, utilities and financials are driving the stock market . Whether Big Tech can re-establish its historical dominance in 2025 is the existential question facing investors .  Hedge funds on Tuesday snapped up US equities at the fastest pace since April 9 . Technology stocks were the biggest beneficiaries of the buying . Betting on Big Tech a decade ago resulted in a gain of 2,179%, compared with 181% for the S&P 500 .  The Magnificent Seven accounts for about a third of the benchmark’s market capitalization . The mega-tech index is down 4.2% for the year compared with a 1.3% rise in the S&P 500 . “I think all-time highs are possible,” Gardner says .  Since the S&P 500 bottomed on April, tech stocks have led the way higher, with the sector rising 31% compared with a 20% gain for the entire index . Betting on a tech rally comes with its own risks . Trump could resume his hard-line approach to tariffs when his 90-day pause ends in July .  Consumer sentiment is at the second-lowest level on record and inflation expectations are at multi-decade highs . Apple reported a 2% decline in China sales in its fiscal second quarter . Apple has lost more than $700 billion in market value since closing at a record on Dec. 26 .  Searches on Apple’s Safari web browser fell for the first time in April, an Apple executive said in court testimony last week .

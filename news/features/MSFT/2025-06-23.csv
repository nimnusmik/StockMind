" Palantir stock has advanced more than 2,000% since January 2023, achieving a return that would have turned $5,000 into $107,000 . The company is a recognized leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning platforms, a market forecasted to grow at 40% annually through 2028 .  Palantir continued to show near-flawless execution in the first quarter . Revenue increased 39% to $884 million, marking the seventh consecutive acceleration . The company's AI and machine learning platforms have applications across almost every industry . ""Palantir is quietly becoming one of the largest players in this market,"" wrote analyst Mike Gualtieri .  Palantir must increase at least 20 times in value (equivalent to a 1,900% return) over the next decade to turn $5,000 into $100,000 . Shares advanced by over 2,000% in the last 30 months .  Palantir's share price is unlikely to increase 20-fold during the next decade . Multiplying that by 20 would bring its market value to $6.5 trillion, which seems implausible, given that Microsoft is currently the world's largest company and its value is just $3.5 billion . Palanir stock would need to gain 35% annually over the next 10 years to achieve a total return of 1,900% .  Palantir's revenue increased by only 39% last quarter, so the odds of revenue growing at 49% annually for the next 10 years are remote at best . The company is executing on a tremendous market opportunity, but the current valuation is absurd .

" ChatGPT developer OpenAI has been at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution for more than two years . Teaming up with OpenAI could be a transformative move for Alphabet as its core search business continues to face pressure .  Microsoft's investment in OpenAI wasn't just about raising capital . As part of their partnership, OpenAI became tightly integrated into Microsoft's cloud service, Azure . Recent moves from ChatGPT maker suggest it's looking to avoid vendor lock-in with Microsoft .  Working with OpenAI may look odd from the outside as the platform could be seen as both a technical competitor and existential threat to Google's search business . However, I think there is a more interesting aspect to this relationship whereby Alphabet is hedging the economic profiles of its various platforms .  In a scenario where OpenAI and its peers begin to erode Google search -- thereby taking a toll on Alphabet's advertising revenue -- Alphabet is still able to capture some downstream monetization . Alphabet's cloud infrastructure business captures revenue that is otherwise lost from the consumer-facing advertising segment of Google search .  Alphabet trades at a considerable discount compared to its cloud hyperscaler peers on a forward earnings basis . Some investors may be of the opinion that Alphabet entered the cloud computing race far too late and will never catch up to Amazon or Microsoft . The irony from Alphabet's deal with OpenAI is that the company might actually have unlocked a backdoor channel to continue thriving even as its core search business faces mounting pressure .

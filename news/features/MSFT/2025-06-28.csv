Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang encapsulated a seismic shift in technology with a statement .  Nvidia has become synonymous with the AI revolution, powering advancements in everything from autonomous vehicles to scientific research .

Instead of one-shot ChatGPT, it's now a reasoning model, and it generates a ton more tokens” Huang continued, “Those thinking models, reasoning models achieve incredible performance, but they require a lot more computational capability.”  Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips represent a leap in computational performance, specifically designed to meet the demands of next-generation AI models . The Blackwell architecture enables unprecedented speed and efficiency, supporting the complex reasoning and multi-step problem-solving capabilities that define modern AI systems .  Huang’s statement centers on the rise of “reasoning models” in AI . These advanced systems go beyond simple input-output tasks to engage in processes akin to logical deduction, planning, and self-reflection . Unlike traditional language models, these advanced systems can break down problems, explore multiple solutions, and even critique their own outputs .

" Alphabet’s valuation is sharply lower than that of its mega-cap, tech-focused peers . It has a diversified business but is still heavily dependent on Google Search . However, competition could actually benefit Alphabet in the long run .  The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is simply the price of a stock divided by earnings per share over the last 12 months . The P/E ratio has some major flaws . Smoothing out the ratio by comparing it to historical averages over a period of time can be effective ways to get a better reading on a company's profitability .  The S&P 500's forward P/E ratio is 21.8, which is higher than its historical average . However, it is lower than every Magnificent Seven stock except Alphabet . Alphabet is cheaper than the benchmark, despite being such a dominant, industry-leading company .  Alphabet makes the vast majority of its revenue from services like Google Search, YouTube, Google Network, subscriptions, devices, and platforms . Google Search brought in over $50 billion in revenue, which made up 65.6% of total services revenue . The sheer size of Google Search compared to YouTube illustrates the company's dependence on Google Search .  Google Search's seemingly impenetrable moat has been threatened by other information resources such as ChatGPT, Claude, TikTok, and Meta Platforms' Instagram . Given the rapid adoption of these tools, it's not unreasonable to assume that time spent on Google Search may decrease .  Alphabet has become a better, more innovative company thanks to tools like ChatGPT . Integrating Gemini across the Alphabet ecosystem could help accelerate the company's growth . Google's days of being the undisputed leader in search are over, but competition isn't inherently bad .  The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years . Consider when Netflixmade this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $687,731!

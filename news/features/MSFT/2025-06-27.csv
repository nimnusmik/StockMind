The ROE is great at 33.61%, while the industry median is only at 4.96% .  Microsoft's EV/EBITDA ratio at 22.8 is a 31% premium to the industry median . P/S and P/B ratios are even more elevated at 12.51 and 10.49, suggesting a 311% and 214% premium . Only ROE growth is a weak point in this sector, with both current and forward ROE Growth expected to be negative .

Nvidia trades at a forward price-earnings (P/E) multiple of almost 37x . If Nvidia were to rise to $200, it would trade at around 50x its expected EPS this year .  NVDA stock currently has momentum, and I don't see any immediate risk to the rally, barring a macroeconomic shock . The next trigger for Nvidia could be a potential easing of China export restrictions, or the company coming up with a new chip that it can export under the current set of rules .

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in the latest earnings report, ""When there are uncertain environments, customers tend to choose the provider they trust most"" Ricky Mulvey: These are the times when you really want to be keeping an eye out there for a lot of those great businesses that perhaps can be going on sale, so to speak .

He's got a point there, Amazon is this big machine for substituting goods. They can get stronger. Amazon is a platform business on the e-commerce side .  Amazon Web Services just continues to be this juggernaut . Management really wasn't that worried about tariffs . Overall, this was a very decent quarter for Amazon . I see some near-term trouble ahead for Amazon that might last a quarter or two .  Most of that operating income is coming from Amazon Web Services . Operating income in total up by more than 20% from a year ago . Ricky Mulvey: Amazon has a pretty solid business that can get stronger in this environment .  Ricky Mulvey: Meta is telling investors a story with AI and glasses, and Apple is using $100 billion to buy back stock . We'll talk about that after the break .  The overall message from Zuck seemed to be, AI is going to sell Meta users more stuff and keep you on those platforms for longer . Jason Moser: Ricky, what happened to the word Metaverse?  Meta is basically there with its AI aspirations, but certainly a good corner of the market received it very well . Revenue of $412 million, that was actually down, but this thing is still chalking up massive losses . $4.2 billion in operating losses just for the quarter .  Facebook Inc. raised guidance on their CapEx spend for the full year to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion . That's up from 60-65 billion just a quarter ago .

Asit Sharma: Apple, Amazon, Microsoft make up about 20% of the whole market cap of the S&P 500 . Jason Moser: These are the times when the strong gets stronger, and so they're the ones that are going to be able to weather the storm .

The park has five separate lands, SuperNintendoworld, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, the Ministry of Magic . Rick Munarriz: ""I've never seen a park that looks this good before it opens""  The Ministry of Magic Ride is down more often than it's up, but everything else is beautiful . The details are great. The ecosystem is there for all these restaurants, very different restaurants. There's a hotel literally in the back of the park where you can walk in .  Universal Studios has a lot of advanced animatronics on display at the park . Rick Munarriz: Universal Studios is not just about rides and roller coasters, but it's also about animatronic creatures .

Mary Long: It's one thing to go to a theme park like this and to experience it as a guest .  Epic Universe is not selling annual passes at all at Epic Universe . Instead, you have to pay 140, 150, $160 for a day at the park instead of spending 500, 600, $700 for an annual pass . They are going to be making a lot of money at this park .

Royal Caribbean, the stock is up 63% over the past year .  Royal Caribbean is a company that has historically grown faster than Norwegian Cruise Lines has produced better margins . Norwegian Cruise had to be fair of the decline . Part of it was that some of their large ships were in dry dock .  Rick Munnariz: ""I would say yes, but mostly no. one company and Norwegian Cruise Line. There is a difference. To me, I don't have to fly to the major ports. All three of the major cruise lines have ports""  Royal Caribbean said that their cancellation rate for this last quarter was no different than it was before . But when we get to later in the year, the economy does have to play along because even though a lot of the people that go on cruises, they may be older .

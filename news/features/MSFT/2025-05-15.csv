Recent volatility in both stocks has reignited interest in evaluating their investment potential .

The U.S. federal government, where federal revenues grew more than 100% in fiscal 2024 .  Sales cycles with Microsoft have shortened by approximately 20%, a testament to the strength of their joint go-to-market motions . C3.ai and Microsoft were engaged in more than 600 active enterprise opportunities globally . Subscription revenues grew 22% year over year to $85.7 million, constituting 87% of total revenues .

The 2025 EPS estimates have trended upward over the past 60 days for PATH stock while the same remained unchanged .

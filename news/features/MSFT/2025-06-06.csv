" Meta Platforms Inc.’s flashy deal this week for nuclear power was just the latest sign of the technology industry's need for more energy . While the top US reactor companies are eager to sign more contracts, the big question remains: Will new generation come online quickly enough?  It's been more than a decade since the US last broke ground on a large-scale nuclear power plant that came online . Nuclear is especially well suited for technology companies with ambitious climate goals because it's a clean-energy source .  Power demand in the US is expected to soar as much as 15% in some regions by the end of the decade . Texas alone has said it will need the equivalent of 30 conventional nuclear reactors to meet the growing demand from AI .  Algorithms that were developed in the early 2020s are being deployed now, with the goal of testing and perfecting the models’ ability to think and solve problems . More nuclear may be available, but not until “the tail end of the first wave,” Alam says .  Meta is also planning upgrades at several existing plants that could add the equivalent of an entire new reactor . The company says it has a lot of capacity that would be available to customers . But analysts say it's not clear that will be enough for the next several years .  Bloomberg L.P. use a $400 billion green bank to finance billions of dollars in loans for projects including nuclear reactors . Even if a major new nuclear plant went into construction immediately, it would likely be years before it would be able to send electricity to data centers .",positive,"reactors, reactor, nuclear, upgrades, generation"
" Microsoft first became the world's biggest company based on market cap in September 1998 . It stayed No. 1 for less than 18 months before being dethroned . Nvidia is in the best position to knock Microsoft off its perch with its market cap already topping $3.3 trillion .  Nvidia is poised to be the biggest beneficiary of several artificial intelligence (AI) trends, notably including the rapid adoption of AI agents that can reason . The restrictions on AI chip exports to China will hurt its growth to some extent . I don't think this headwind will keep Nvidia from becoming much larger over the next decade .  The big question hovering over Apple is: What's the next big breakthrough product for the company? I think smart glasses just might be the much-anticipated next huge hit for Apple . Rumors are circulating that the company plans to launch its first AI-enhanced glasses as early as late 2026 .  Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be able to hold on to its leadership in the cloud services market more strongly than I anticipated in the past . Without OpenAI's ChatGPT, I don't believe Microsoft would claim the largest market cap today . Another reason why I'm more optimistic about Amazon now is that it might be able launch smart glasses that become nearly as must-have as the iPhone years ago .  Amazon must grow significantly faster than Microsoft over the next 10 years for its market cap to become larger . Its AI initiatives are impressive, including the development of its own AI chips .

It isn't cheap at 64 times this year's earnings .  Arm's chip designs are now installed in approximately 99% of the world's smartphones . Most of its growth over the past few years has been fueled by its AI-optimized Armv9 designs . Analysts expect that figure to grow at a CAGR of 21% over the next three years .  Arm's stock isn't cheap at 113 times this year's earnings, but it could be a great long-term play on the market's growing demand for more power-efficient AI chips .

" As of the end of March, a mix of four well-known AI hardware and applications companies made up roughly 30% of Coatue Management's invested assets . The deadline for institutional investors overseeing at least $100 million in assets to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange is May 15 .  Coatue Management's Philippe Laffont ended March with $22.7 billion in assets under management . He leans heavily into growth stocks and companies riding the latest technological waves, such as the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution .  In four of the last five quarters, social media titan Meta Platforms has been billionaire Philippe Laffont's top holding . Coatue's more than 3.75-million-share stake equated to almost $2.2 billion in market value at the end of March .  Meta Platforms also has the luxury of an enviable treasure chest . Its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities collectively topped $70 billion at the end of March . Amazon has been a top-four holding for Coatue Management since the start of 2024 .  Amazon Web Services (AWS) is pacing $117 billion in annual run-rate revenue . AWS entered 2025 accounting for a 33% share of global cloud infrastructure service spending . Amazon's other high-growth ancillary segments are playing key roles in its growth .  The third largest holding in Philippe Laffont's fund for a second consecutive quarter is world-leading chip fabrication companyTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing . TSMC is in the process of increasing its CoWoS capacity from around 35,000 units per month in 2024 to 135,000 wafers per month by 2026 .  Laffont's sizable wager on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing might also have to do with it building advanced-chip production facilities in the U.S. President Trump's threat of imposing tariffs on imports, including the possibility of tariffs, is more of a moot point with TSMC investing in America . The fourth AI stock that accounts for about 30% of Coatue Management's $22.7 billion in invested assets is Microsoft .  Microsoft is aggressively deploying generative AI and LLM tools in its cloud infrastructure service platform . Microsoft's legacy operations aren't slouches, either . Even though the growth heyday for Windows and Office is long gone, Microsoft's software still dominates .  Meta Platforms ended March with $79.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments . The company generated $37 billion in net cash from operations in just three months .

" Nintendo announced the Switch 2, the long-awaited successor of its wildly popular Nintendo Switch . The Switch 2’s June 5 launch was poised to be a shot in the arm for Nintendo and the video game industry . A few hours later, Donald Trump announced his Liberation Day tariffs, including steep taxes on imports from China, Vietnam, Japan, and Cambodia .  Nintendo paused U.S. preorders to assess the “potential impact of tariffs .” It reopened them a few weeks later, maintaining the $450 price point and June 5 launch . The Switch 2 is still likely to be a success, even if not quite as much as Nintendo hoped .  Nintendo is one of Asia’s most prominent consumer-tech companies, an Asian brand with true global reach . After struggling to stay relevant in the 2010s, Nintendo unveiled the Switch in 2017: an affordable handheld console that could connect to a television . With 150-million-plus units sold as of March 2025, the Switch is the third-bestselling console of all time .  Nintendo sold over 27 million consoles in 2020 alone . But eight years is an eternity in the video game world, and the Switch console was showing its age . Nintendo reported a 30% drop in sales in its most recent fiscal year .  Nintendo was one of the first companies to shift manufacturing out of China to nearby Vietnam and Cambodia in 2019 . Its market value is over $90 billion, making it Japan’s eighth-most-valuable firm .  Preorders in markets like the U.S. and Japan sold out instantly . Nintendo is even selling a cheaper version that works only with games bought in Japan . The company is trying to scale back expectations, forecasting lower-than-expected Switch sales .  Shuntaro Furukawa said the company was factoring in a profit hit worth “several tens of billions of yen” Microsoft implemented a $100 price hike for the Xbox Series X . Sony has avoided hiking PlayStation prices in the U.S., but raised prices elsewhere .  By making the first move to $80, Nintendo might have done the industry a favor . ""There’s real potential for the Switch to change a lot of things about the way games are made,"" Gerstmann says .  Nintendo's struggles are indicative of a broader tension in Trump’s tariff regime . Vietnam and Cambodia are two popular “China plus one” destinations, where manufacturers based final assembly so as to avoid tariffs on China-made products .

Nvidia's chips -- graphics processing units (GPUs) -- fuel this process that allows large language models to think through problems and generate answers .

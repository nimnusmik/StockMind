" Amazon has a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion, but it could hit the $3 trillion milestone by the end of 2026 . The tech conglomerate operates the world's largest e-commerce and cloud computing platforms . Amazon is generating rapid earnings growth, and it's trading at an attractive valuation right now .  Amazon Web Services wants to dominate the three core layers of AI: hardware, large language models, and software . Investors who buy its stock today could earn a return of 36% over the next 18 months if it joins the $3 trillion club .  AWS Bedrock includes NovaSonic speech-to-speech model, which paves the way for conversational (voice-powered) AI applications . Q has actually become the most capable AI coding assistant in the industry . AWS generated $29.2 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2025 .  Amazon's largest source of revenue is still e-commerce, which carries very low profit margins . More than 70% of the products sold on Amazon come from China, so they are subject to a 30% import tariff . That means Amazon will have to pass the added costs on to customers or risk operating at a loss .  Amazon generated $1.59 in earnings per share (EPS) during the first quarter, which was an eye-popping 62% increase compared to the year-ago period . Amazon's trailing-12-month EPS is $6.13, which places its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.5 .  Wall Street's consensus estimate suggests Amazon could generate $7.27 in EPS during 2026, so a P/E ratio of 38 would equal a share price of $276.26 . That would imply a market cap of around $2.95 trillion by the end of next year .

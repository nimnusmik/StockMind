" Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in arecent interview that AI now does up to 50% of all work at the company . In May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said 20% to 30% of the tech giant’s code is now written by AI coding assistants .  The metrics cited seem precise, yet when asked, their spokespeople declined to provide any details about how the numbers were calculated or how they defined the work that they claim AI has done . “We don’t yet have a common framework for measuring what ‘percent of work’ really means in the age of AI,” said Malvika Jethmalani, founder of human capital advisory firm Atvis Group .  Salesforce CEO describes AI's ability to do up to half the work at his company as a “digital labor revolution” Benioff didn’t clarify what “work” means in this context . He mentioned using AI to co-author Salesforce’s corporate plan, but did not detail what that plan was or how much AI contributed .  CEO Benioff said that AI technology is already being used as employees within an organization . The flex can even cause anxiety among employees who hear it as “we're automating you out,” an occupational psychologist said .  Research from firms likeGartners says many AI-driven projects are likely to fail by 2027 because their value is unclear . Companies also must deal with the disconnect between what C-suite executives say about AI and what’s actually happening on the ground .  CEOs may be using this flex as little more than a boast to competitors, Bester said . CEOs are saying “just look at us, we are ahead of the curve on this,” he said . For now, CEOs “obviously want to show their stakeholders that they are on board with AI”  Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowskireversedan AI-driven hiring freeze and announced the company is adding more human staff .

Canada cannot afford to be complacent to the threat that the United States has the power to turn off our digital lights .  U.S. President Donald Trump demanded that Canada rescind the digital services tax as a precondition to trade negotiations . Canada’s critical digital infrastructure is overwhelmingly dominated by American companies . The cloud computing market, which underlies virtually all digital services, is the wrong place to give ground .  Canada’s willingness to accept American control of our digital infrastructure is puzzling considering the pains we take to guarantee the independence of other aspects of our information ecosystem . The data-hungry nature of the digital economy means that incumbents are able to use their position to map existing control models onto emerging technologies, like artificial intelligence .  In Europe, the revelation that American tech products could be used as a point of leverage sent governments scrambling to review their exposure . Canada needs to chart a similar course, and prioritize diversifying away from our reliance on American tech .  Canada should invest in creative solutions to break out of the existing platform-dominated paradigm and empower domestic champions such as the newly launched Gander Social . The government could lead the way by beginning to migrate its own digital presence away from American-dominated tech .  Canada needs more teamwork and fewer turf wars to get major projects built . Much of it is likely to draw the ire of a U.S. administration that has developed an astonishingly cozy relationship with the same Silicon Valley titans who just a few years ago decried Donald Trump as too dangerous to even give an account to .

" Nada Snoussi says mass layoffs at companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Dell, Klarna, and Google led her to ask how AI job disruption is affecting investment promotion agencies (IPAs) One of IPAs’ primary goals is to create job opportunities for the places they represent through foreign investment projects .  Snoussi says while AI will replace some jobs, it is also creating new ones . IPAs will have to be more agile to the needs of an evolving workforce, she says .  Snoussi says IPAs should look at which sector-specific AI companies would complement their local economy . IPAs must also look at how AI will be applied to other sectors, such as agriculture and healthcare .  IPAs could play an important role in advocating for the upskilling of their local workforce . If IPAs attract projects without taking these factors into consideration, they could inadvertently disrupt the local economy .

" With Apple and Tesla struggling, perhaps it's time for a shake-up in the ""Magnificent Seven"" lineup . Palantir's revenue growth is accelerating, and its long-term opportunities appear to be huge . Broadcom reports strong growth in its networking portfolio and has an even bigger opportunity in custom AI chips .  Both Apple and Tesla stocks have had poor starts to 2025 . The reason for Apple's share price underperformance is that its revenue growth has slowed to a glacial pace . A big part of Apple's issues is that it has not innovated.

The company recently landed a significant contract with NATO, showing that international defense has the potential to become a third meaningful growth pillar .

Palantir and Broadcom look today like better candidates than Apple or Tesla to form a new Magnificent Seven . Broadcom has stated that each one of them intends to deploy fabrics of 1 million AI chip clusters in 2027, representing a total serviceable opportunity for the company of $60 billion to $90 billion in that year alone .

Some customers may take their foot off the gas as the market matures, impacting Nvidia's growth rate . The company could take a $5.5 billion charge related to tariffs and trade restrictions with China .  Even if Nvidia's growth slows to around 30% per year, the stock is arguably still a great value . At $157.75 per share at the time of this writing, Nvidia would have a 36.8 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio .

" While Netflix, Amazon, and Nvidia have delivered spectacular returns, they lack the diversification needed for a single-stock portfolio . Berkshire Hathaway operates like an expertly curated ETF, owning 68 distinct companies . Despite not owning Berkshire myself, I recognize it as the safest choice for investors seeking a single long-term holding .  Netflix was an early name in my portfolio, inspired by fellow Fool Rick Munarriz's in-depth analysis of the company in the mid-2000s . When Netflix went through the Qwikster-branded separation of DVD and streaming services, I doubled down on my investment at a fantastic price .  My oldest Amazon investment is only up by 430% since January 2017 . I wish I had pounced on Amazon much earlier, like Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner did . Amazon is not a one-trick pony, but the company should pick up a few more skills .  The early leader in AI accelerator hardware could very well run into a superior alternative in the next few years . The risk only grows larger if you stretch the timeline out over decades . The next market-defining AI winner could be some upstart I haven't heard of yet .  Berkshire Hathaway owns and operates 68 distinct companies these days . The names range from GEICO car insurance to Duracell batteries . Berkshire dabbles in e-commerce (Oriental Trading Company) and clothing (Fruit of the Loom)  Berkshire Hathaway owns a $60.7 billion stake in Apple, $45.1 billion in American Express and $28.5 billion in Coca-Cola . Buffett is all about diversity, shielding the company and its investors against the temporary ups and downs in any one particular industry .  Berkshire Hathaway is a safer long-term bet than Nvidia, Netflix, or Amazon . The Motley Fool's total average return is792% -- a market-crushing outperformance compared to171% for the S&P 500 .

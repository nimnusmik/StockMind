" Apple (AAPL) faced Epic Games in a landmark court case in 2021 . Apple was ordered to let developers inform users about payment methods outside its app store . Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers dramatically escalated the ongoing legal battle between Apple and Epic Games .  Judge Rogers ruled Apple's response to the injunction as deliberately anticompetitive . Apple had secretly imposed a 27% fee on transactions conducted through external links, barely lower than their usual commission . Rogers referred both Apple and Alex Roman to federal prosecutors for potential criminal contempt charges .  Apple filed an emergency appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court, arguing that compliance with the injunction would cause significant financial harm . Apple claimed that allowing unrestricted external payment methods could cost the company billions in annual revenue, severely undermining its App Store business model . Judge Rogers refused to delay enforcing her order, emphasizing Apple’s repeated delays and clear non-compliance . Legal analysts predict that Apple faces significant hurdles in its appeal due to the abundance of evidence presented against it .  Epic Games submitted Fortnite for review, aiming to resume availability on iPhones and iPads . Apple's compliance remains uncertain, as the injunction does not explicitly force Apple to restore Epic’s developer account or immediately approve the fan-favorite game . The outcome of this conflict extends far beyond Apple and Epic Games .  The ruling aligns with new regulations such as the European Digital Markets Act . The U.S. Department of Justice has its own antitrust case against Apple . The ruling energized a coalition of developers and companies, including Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Match (MTCH)  On Wall Street, Apple carries a Moderate Buy rating with 17 Buys, eight Holds, and four Sells over the past three months . Despite the ongoing legal squabble, Apple stock remains resilient .  The potential financial repercussions for Apple are substantial, with billions of dollars in annual revenue potentially at risk . The mandated adjustments to Apple’s App Store policies could compel the company to reevaluate core elements of its longstanding business strategy .",negative,"apple, appeal, court, injunction, antitrust"
" Nvidia is arguably in a better position to become the first to reach a $4 trillion market cap than any other company . The timing of when Nvidia hits that mark is up in the air, though, because of economic uncertainty . Nvidia just rejoined Apple and Microsoft in the $3 trillion club .  The White House'stariffshave also had a major impact on Nvidia's share price . The recent 90-day pause on some of the tariffs provided more reason for optimism . Microsoft's shares trade at nearly 30 times forward earnings .  Wall Street expects Nvidia's earnings to soar around 47% this fiscal year and 29% in the next fiscal year . Apple's earnings are expected to increase 18% this year and 9% next year . Nvidia is a hair behind with shares trading at 26.9 times forward earnings . But the growth prospects for these tech giants aren't equal .  Nvidia's market cap would need to jump by roughly 25% to hit $4 trillion . However, many variables are at play that could make the goal harder to achieve in a relatively short time . I predict that Nvidia will be the first $4trillion stock, but I'll leave the date by which it reaches the mark open .  Now is the best time to buy before it’s too late .

" The S&P 500 is less than 1% away from returning to positive territory for the year . The most important companies in the major indexes continued to perform well last quarter .  There's no perfect science for knowing when a sell-off is about to start nor for gauging when one is over . But there are some simple indicators you can use to gauge market sentiment . Growth-focused and cyclical sectors like tech, consumer discretionary, communications, and financials tend to do well .  Another good indicator to watch is the CBOE Volatility Index, commonly known as the VIX . The VIX was at its lowest point of the year when the S&P 500 was near its all-time high in late February . Then, shortly after President Trump unveiled his global tariffs on April 2, VIX spiked in lockstep with a massive sell-off . In the last few weeks, the Vix has been falling and the S.P 500 has been climbing, a combination that could signal that the worst of the sell off is over .  The steep tariffs that Trump imposed led to a host of countries imposing their own higher tariffs on U.S. exports . Corporate leaders didn't shy away from outlining the effects these tariffs would have on their businesses . It also shows the degree to which the market despises uncertainty .  Several companies saw their stock prices get crushed for the wrong reasons . Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and American Express are examples of companies that were doing just fine even when trade war tensions were hot .  Investors can take a similar approach by not overhauling their investment portfolios based on factors that don't pertain to the underlying investment theses of their holdings . Accept that rough conditions can get worse before they get better . The same approach applies when the market is going up .

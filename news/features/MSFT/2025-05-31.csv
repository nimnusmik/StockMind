" Apple could be heavily impacted by tariffs, but the long-term investment thesis is sound . Microsoft continues to fire on all cylinders and deserves to be near an all-time high . Visa and American Express benefit from network effects that help them steadily grow over time .  Apple assembles the vast majority of key products, like iPhones, in China . President Trump has cast Apple onto the front lines of the trade war with China, with the latest decision being a 25% tariff on iPhones not made in the U.S.  Apple may just have to absorb the tariff hit and hope resolutions come soon or pass along a portion of the costs to consumers . The good news is that Apple has highly anticipated products with AI features coming this fall which may be enough to pique consumer interest and justify higher price tags .  Visa has a simpler business model and is arguably lower risk and lower reward than American Express . It is a pure-play payment processor that collects fees based on the frequency and volume of transactions on its credit and debit cards . The more cards engaged with the network, the more potential Visa has for collecting fees .  American Express is so profitable that it converts around two-thirds of every dollar in sales into operating income . Visa's expenses mainly go toward maintaining its network, American Express spends more on card member rewards than on operating expenses . American Express attracts affluent customers due to the high annual fees on its cards .  Apple, Microsoft, Visa, and American Express have seen their stock prices grow rapidly . As a result, their dividend yields have compressed even though all four companies consistently boost their payouts year after year . All four companies regularly repurchase stock, meaning that the dividend isn't the only means of returning capital to shareholders .

" IonQ andMicrosoft Corporation MSFT are making waves in the emerging field of quantum computing . IonQ is a pure-play quantum computing pioneer, focused solely on developing cutting-edge quantum computers and networks . Microsoft is a tech giant weaving quantum technology into its massive Azure cloud platform .  In first-quarter 2025, the company secured its first commercial sale, a $22 million deal with EPB, a utility in Tennessee, to deploy its Forte Enterprise quantum computer and quantum network . IonQ is aggressively expanding its reach through strategic partnerships and acquisitions .  For 2025, IonQ forecasts revenue between $75 million and $95 million – roughly 97% growth . IonQ is also building out a full-stack quantum ecosystem . The U.S. government has recognized IonQ’s capabilities .  In first-quarter 2025, IonQ’s net loss was $32.3 million (narrower than a year ago due to some one-time gains), and its adjusted EBITDA loss actually widened as operating expenses jumped 38% year over year . The quantum computing sector is highly competitive .  Microsoft is one of the world’s most valuable companies, with a dominant position in enterprise software and cloud computing . Unlike IonQ, Microsoft benefits from significant profitability and a broad economic moat across multiple tech sectors . Its Azure cloud platform is pivotal to its quantum strategy, providing access to a range of quantum hardware .  Microsoft unveiled its Majorana 1 quantum processing chip in early 2025 . Microsoft has $80 billion in cash reserves to continue investing in quantum initiatives . Microsoft is primed to capitalize on quantum advancements, offering quantum computing-as-a-service when the technology matures .  Microsoft's quantum hardware progress lags behind competitors like IBM, which has built over 100 qubit superconducting processors . IonQ has recently garnered attention with a significant 57.8% surge in its stock price over the past month, despite a modest 3.4% year-to-date gain .  Microsoft has been pacing the broader tech rally, whereas IonQ’s surge was an outlier . The Zacks Computer and Technology sector has gained 8.3% in the past month but declined 1.7% YTD . Valuation remains a key concern for IonQ, with a forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio of 91.76 .  IonQ’s premium valuation is heavily dependent on its ability to execute its strategy and secure a leading position in the emerging quantum market before its competitors . Microsoft trades at about 10.99X, far below IONQ but above the sector, but much lower than that of IonQ .  IonQ and Microsoft each represent compelling but distinct plays in the quantum cloud space . IonQ is a high-risk, high-reward investment with impressive growth prospects . Microsoft offers a more stable investment with a dominant presence in the cloud and AI sectors backed by a robust financial position .  IonQ is the stock with greater upside potential right now . Its Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold) position it as a more conservative investment .

" Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management fund made some major purchases of top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks during the first quarter . If a fund has over $100 million in assets, it is required to divulge its end-of-quarter holdings to the SEC .  During the first quarter, Tiger Global Management purchased a few big-time AI stocks . These included Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing . All four of these stocks were already in the fund's portfolio prior to Q1 .  Taiwan Semiconductor stock can be purchased for under 21 times forward earnings . This is a lower-than-market multiple, yet Taiwan Semi is expected to deliver monster growth over the next five years . Management believes its AI-related revenue can increase at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR)  Wall Street analysts expect 53% revenue growth in fiscal year 2026 (ending January 2026) and 24% next year . Amazon isn't a revenue growth story; it's a margin expansion story . Microsoft is expected to grow revenue at a 14% and 13% pace in 2025 and 2026 .  While Microsoft has proven to be a strong and resilient business over the past few years, I don't think I'd want to own the stock as much as the other three . It's just as expensive as Amazon and Nvidia, yet it doesn't have quite the growth upside to justify the cost .

" The S&P 500 was down by as much as 19% from its all-time high after President Trump announced his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on April 2 . The index has erased those losses since then because several countries have come to the table to negotiate new trade deals .  The Vanguard Information Technology ETF outperformed the S&P 500 every year, on average, since it was established in 2004 . It currently holds 307 stocks spread across 12 subsegments of the sector .

" Appaloosa's billionaire chief David Tepper completely exited or substantially reduced his fund's stakes in five brand-name artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in the March-ended quarter . The deadline for institutional investors overseeing at least $100 million to fileForm 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission was May 15 .  David Tepper of Appaloosa Management traded 130,000 shares in AI-networking specialistBroadcom . Tepper's net-selling of artificial intelligence stocks was his first-quarter trading activity . As of the end of March, Tepper oversaw close to $8.4 billion in assets under management .  Based on Appaloosa's 13F, Tepper sold shares of five prominent artificial intelligence stocks in the March-ended quarter . It's quite possible this selling activity represents nothing more than simple profit-taking . Shares of Nvidia, Microsoft, AMD, Lam Research have all rocketed higher as the AI revolution has taken shape .  The worry is that there may be more than just benign profit-taking and/or stop losses (in Intel's case) behind Tepper's aggressive net selling of AI stocks . On one hand, demand for AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI solutions has been exceptionally strong . Nvidia's Hopper (H100) and Blackwell GPUs hold a seemingly insurmountable market share lead in AI-accelerated data centers . Intel's central processing units are also playing a role in the expansion of AI-data center infrastructure .  Many of Nvidia's largest customers are internally developing AI chips to use in their data centers . This is expected to weigh on Nvidia's pricing power, as well as AMD and possibly even Intel . It also has the potential to adversely impact the pricing power for semiconductor equipment companies like Lam Research .  If the AI bubble were to burst, we'd see widespread weakness among the five prominent AI stocks Tepper completely exited or reduced in the March-ended quarter . Every game-changing technology needs time to mature, and AI isn't anywhere close to having reached the point of maturity .  David Tepper may be allowing these odds to partially guide his investment strategy .

" The stock market's crazy first five months of 2025 have left Wall Street pros in a pickle . The benchmark is basically flat for 2025 and putting up one of its worst starts to a year since the 1950s . It's also getting handily beaten by stock markets around the world .  Over the past 30 years, the S&P’s average return is roughly flat for June, as much of Wall Street begins its summer holiday season . Corporate executives are as pessimistic as they’ve been since 2022, according to a recent CEO confidence survey .  The S&P 500’s 19% plunge from its Feb. 19 record pushed it into a correction in just 16 trading days and brought it to the brink of a bear market . But after its almost 19% rebound since then, equity valuations have gotten much more stretched . US stocks are trailing the MSCI All Country World Index excluding the US Index by 12 percentage points in 2025 .  Historically, the third year of a US bull market, like now, is the weakest . Since World War II, the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of just 5.2% in year three . Since 1947, bull markets have averaged 55 months .  The market’s best performing sector this year is industrials, an optimistic sign for shares and growth . Defensive plays like utilities and consumer staples companies are also atop the leader board . Consumer discretionary shares that house some of the biggest retailers, homebuilders and automakers are among the worst performers this year .  In post-US presidential election years over the past seven decades, the S&P 500 has struggled in early June as investors booked profits heading into the summer . This is particularly true if the index gets a strong boost in May, like it did this year with a 6.2% jump .",negative,"markets, stocks, 2025, stock, market"

" Federal judge who will decide how to limit Google’s monopoly in search is considering its advantage in artificial intelligence . Judge Amit Mehta aims to minimize harm to the other players in the market with any resolution . It will be up to MehtA to decide whether to break up the company and reshape the internet .  The government has asked Mehta to ban Google from paying for search engine defaults . It also wants Google to sell its Chrome web browser and share some of the data it collects to create its search results .  Questions focused on Justice Department's proposal for forward-looking, long-term measures to reform Google . Antitrust regulators have argued that Google’s dominance in traditional search could extend to generative AI, which is becoming a key gateway for how users access information online . Google's counterproposal would allow that opportunity to occur .  DOJ says cutting off Google's payments to Apple, Mozilla and others to distribute its search engine would cause widespread market harm . Mehta: ""Every single distribution partner said, ‘This would harm us’ still allow for the company to split revenue with competing browsers .  Google argues that it is the market leader in search because of more than 20 years of innovation . The government's proposals would hurt American consumers and the economy, Google argues . The company's lead lawyer John Schmidtlein objected to any payment ban .  Mehta appeared skeptical of Google's argument for more limited remedies, indicating he is considering including AI-related measures in his decision . Schmidtlein countered that gen AI products are not in the relevant market for search . AI chatbots are already seen as an existential threat to traditional search engines .  AI-drafted responses replacing the need to present people with a long list of search results pointing across the web . As the trial unfolded in April and May, some representatives from AI companies told the court they are already being stymied by Google .  Chrome is a significant part of Google's search business, a DOJ lawyer says . The judge's questions about the remedy suggested concern about whether the divestiture would actually achieve its intended competitive benefits . Representatives of two prominent AI startups testified during the trial that their companies would be interested in buying Chrome if Google forced to divest it .  Google argued that any divested Chrome would be “a shadow of the current Chrome’s current Chrome,” harming competition instead of helping it . Google would be barred from paying for placement on Chrome again if the payment ban was lifted .  Dahlquist said he is “not looking to kneecap Google” but to bolster potential competitors . “We are trying to kickstart competitors, we are not trying to put them on equal footing on day one.”",neutral,"antitrust, google, monopoly, search, competitors"

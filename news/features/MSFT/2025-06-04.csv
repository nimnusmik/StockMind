" AI startups commanding sky-high valuations as corporate boardrooms look to use AI to aid, and sometimes to replace, expensive human software engineers . Cursor, a code generation startup based in San Francisco, raised $900 million at a $10 billion valuation in May . Windsurf, a Mountain View-based startup behind the popular AI coding tool Codeium, attracted the attention of ChatGPT makerOpenAI .  Code-gen startups and their investors believe they are in a land grab situation, with a shrinking window to gain a critical mass of users and establish their AI coding tool as the industry standard .  The rapid growth of these startups is coming despite competing on big tech's home turf . Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot, launched in 2021, grew to over $500 million in revenue last year, according to a source familiar with the matter .  In May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said approximately 20 to 30% of their code is now AI-generated . The same month, the company announced layoffs of 6,000 workers globally . Some ‘vibe-coding’ platforms already boast substantial annualized revenues .  Both Cursor and Windsurf are led by recent MIT graduates in their twenties . But both startups operate with negative gross margins, meaning they spend more than they make . “The prices people are paying for coding assistants are going to get more expensive,” Quinn Slack, CEO at coding startup Sourcegraph, said .  Most of AI coding startups currently rely on the Claude AI model from Anthropic . But some startups are attempting to build their own models . Windsurf announced its first in-house AI models that are optimized for software engineering in a bid to control the user experience .  Poolside has raised more than $600 million to make a coding-specific model . Replit earlier dropped plans to train its own model .

" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang spoke about four key AI growth drivers for his company in Nvidia's Q1 earnings call . These AI megatrends -- reasoning AI, AI diffusion, enterprise AI, and industrial AI -- present huge opportunities for Nvidia . Huang discussed reasoning AI extensively during Nvidia's first-quarter earnings call.  Huang: ""Super agents"" are ""super agents"" that use multiple tools and work in clusters to solve problems . These reasoning AI agents will almost certainly become heavily used by lots of companies over the next few years . They require exponentially more computing power than past AI models . Huang: The skyrocketing demand for this technology will provide a huge tailwind that helps get Nvidia to a $5 trillion market cap .  AI won't be limited to a handful of technologically advanced nations, says Jensen . Jensen correctly observed in the Q1 earnings call that ""countries around the world are awakening to the importance of AI as an infrastructure""  Industrial AI was the last AI megatrend mentioned by Huang . Huang predicted, ""[E]very factory today that makes things will have an AI factory that sits with it"" He believes these AI factories will create and operate AI for the physical factory, plus ""power the products and the things that are made by the factory""  The Motley Fool's total average return is 979% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to171% for the S&P 500 .

" The S&P 500 logged its best May in more than 30 years in large part due to the return of dominance from the""Magnificent Seven""tech stocks . Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Amazon and Nvidia all outperformed the index in May . DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas: Big Tech's recent outperformance shows ""this important slice of the US equity market has genuine momentum""  Magnificent Seven group of stocks grew earnings by a combined 27.7% compared to the same quarter a year ago . That's well above the 9.4% growth seen from the other 493 members of the index . Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit told Yahoo Finance that this helps explain why the group has been outperforming other stocks .  Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon pointed out that Big Tech also led the market lower during the sell-off that began in late February and carried through April . Another reason for the Magnificent Seven's surge is that investors have favored large-cap stocks in the most recent market rally .  The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) hasn't fallen closer to 4%, ""there's only one game in town,"" and it's growth, says Schafer .

" Amazon Web Services is losing market share, and doing so at an accelerating rate . The causes of this growing weakness aren’t apt to ease anytime soon . It’s a problem for current and prospective Amazon shareholders, simply because the stock's priced so its cloud business is bulletproof . This proverbial gravy train might not be quite as impressive in the foreseeable future .  Market research outfit Synergy Research Group keeps track of the numbers, reporting how much the world spends on cloud computing services each and every quarter . Amazon Web Services' share of the world's cloud computingsales fell to a multi-year low (maybe a record low?) during the first quarter of 2025 . That lull extends a downtrend that's been underway since early 2023 .  Much of Amazon's recent loss of market share is to mostly unknown ""other"" providers . As the industry matures, clients are looking for the more specialized options and features that only the smaller cloud computing companies may offer .  If cloud's growth rate slows, look for cloud's commoditization to kick off a price war . Price wars, of course, punch profit margins .

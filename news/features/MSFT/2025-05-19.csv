" Meta Platforms reported Q1 earnings per share (EPS) of $6.43, more than a dollar higher than what Wall Street analysts were expecting . Microsoft beat expectations on both the top and bottom-line in part due to the strength of their Azure cloud segment . Amazon and Apple posted impressive results for the quarter, but their forward looking guidance was less than rosy .  Microsoft increased their capex forecast for 2025, now anticipated to put roughly $80B into the buildout of their AI data centers . Microsoft stock rose 9% in the trading period after their report, while Meta was up 5% . The story was a little different for Amazon and Apple which reported Thursday .  Apple cited tariffs as a major headwind in the current quarter, expected to impact profits to the tune of $900M . As a result the company forecasted operating income for Q2 would be in the range of $13B - $17.5B . Peak earnings season continues with 92 S&P 500 names slated to release results .  Academic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign that the company will share negative news . Eight companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, all of which are later than usual and therefore have negative results .  Ford Motor Company (F), The Clorox Company (CLX), IQVIA Holdings (IQV), Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Johnson Controls (JCI), Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) and ConocoPhillips (COP) are all on our list for this week .

" AI chips and related hardware will receive the largest allocation of infrastructure spend over the next five years . Ongoing spending from cloud hyperscalers underscores strong commitment to data center buildouts and GPUs . These spending dynamics bode particularly well for semiconductor stocks .  McKinsey has called for investment in AI-related data centers . Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon are forecast to spend nearly $260 billion on capex this year alone . Integrating large language models (LLMs) and generative AI into their ecosystems has supercharged growth for megacap tech .  Platformsrecently told investors that it is actually raising its capex budget for 2025 . Broadcom stands to benefit from rising AI infrastructure spend in a couple of ways . Each company currently runs on both Nvidia and AMD chip architecture .  Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and TSMC are well positioned for accelerated growth for years to come . Each company plays a mission-critical role in the development of AI-powered services . The chart below illustrates the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples .  Many investors are sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what management teams have to say in terms of financial guidance over the next quarter or second half of the year . As McKinsey models in its reporting, spending on AI infrastructure -- particularly chips and data centers -- should continue to experience robust growth . For these reasons, I would take advantage of any weakness among these chip stocks .  Now is the best time to buy before it’s too late, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon .

" More than a dozen states have pristine triple-A ratings from Moody’s, according to Bloomberg-compiled data . That's in part thanks to requirements for all but one, including the District of Columbia, to balance their budget .  Moody’s downgrades the federal government to Aa1 . The move reflects deepening concern that ballooning debt and deficits will damage America's standing as the preeminent destination for global capital . The worry was swiftly reflected in market moves Friday as 10-year Treasury yields shot higher .  US states rated AAA by Fitch Ratings kept their top credit ratings even after it downgraded the US to AA+ in 2023 . The impact will likely be felt in some areas of the muni market — just as it was with Fitch’s downgrade .  Moody’s also changed the outlook on its Aaa rating of the Smithsonian Institution to negative from stable . State and local debt tends to take its cues from that market .  Fitch also cut ratings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which remained in government conservatorship . Major holders of the bonds don’t tend to be overly sensitive to changes in government ratings .  Credit ratings for over 400 securities tied to the two entities were lowered in the financial crisis . That in turn caused credit ratings for the two companies to be lowered .

" A bipartisan group of eight U.S. lawmakers has introduced a bill requiring makers of artificial intelligence chips to include technology that verifies the location of their chips before exporting them .

" We recently published a list of10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street Right Now .

" Stocks entered the green for the year as investors cheered the US-China trade thaw . The ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks continued theirrenewed ascent . Earnings from economic bellwethers Cisco (CSCO) and Walmart (WMT) didn't completely suck .  Ex-Medtronic CEO Bill George says CEOs should get away from corporate guidance . He says earnings estimates and corporate guidance are useless in a backdrop where one social media post could blow up company's financial planning .  Walmart reiterated its full-year earnings per share forecast on Thursday after ratcheting down expectations at an investor event several weeks ago . Executives went on to say they would start raising prices (by raising prices)  If tariffs go back to pre-thaw levels, it may render guidance obsolete . Yet, the guidance is out there . Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz decided to pull guidance altogether because of trade uncertainty . United Airlines (UAL) still has its double guidance range out there(which numerous execs have privately made fun of). Yet despite all the confusion, we have the Street looking for earnings growth north of 10% this year .  Earnings estimates and guidance have historically proven to be important drivers of stock prices . To the extent they no longer are, I view it as one more problem for investors to contend with in a challenging 2025 .",negative,"earnings, executives, stocks, stock, forecast"
" MicroStrategy pioneered the idea of buying Bitcoin, and now other companies are starting to follow its example . Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper says corporations have a responsibility to buy Bitcoin to maximize shareholder value . Only a relatively small number of publicly traded companies currently hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets .  Strategy now owns a staggering amount of Bitcoin -- 568,840 coins and counting . It seems that nearly every week, Strategy reports a major buy of more Bitcoin . Its current Bitcoin stockpile is valued at nearly $60 billion . In 2024, a first-of-its-kind shareholder proposal called on Microsoft to start adding Bitcoin to the balance sheet .  Tim Draper is arguing that it is ""irresponsible"" for corporations not to buy Bitcoin . The Microsoft Bitcoin proposal failed, but it should have been a big wake-up call for corporate America .  Investment firm Bernstein recently calculated that publicly traded corporations could add as much as $330 billion in Bitcoin to their combined balance sheets within the next five years . Given Bitcoin's total market cap of $2 trillion, that's a lot of buying and would almost certainly send the price of Bitcoin skyrocketing .  Bitcoin is going to $250,000 by the end of 2025, and one catalyst will be corporations buying Bitcoin in size . The problem is that a strategy of adding Bitcoin to the balance sheet only works if the price of Bitcoin continues to go up . Corporations will actually be reducing, not maximizing, shareholder value by buying Bitcoin .  Bitcoin is simply too volatile to hold a lot of it on a balance sheet . The Motley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them .

" Nvidia has a history of beating Wall Street's earnings estimates . Hints from several major customers are encouraging about the demand for Nvidia's GPUs . Strong demand could boost Nvidia's Q1 results and its outlook for the rest of the year .  Nvidia has topped consensus Wall Street earnings estimates in each of the previous four quarters by at least 5%. Granted, an earnings beat doesn't always translate to a bump in Nvidia's share price . But my hunch is that investors are looking for a reason to be bullish about the once high-flying stock again .  Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in his company's Q1 earnings call that Amazon Web Services has been aggressive in installing Nvidia AI chips as well as its own Trainium chips . Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and its parentAlphabet, highlighted Google's ties with Nvidia . CFO Amy Hood said in her Q3 earnings call, that demand is outpacing capacity for AI services .  Nvidia plans to launch its Blackwell Ultra GPU in the second half of this year . Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated in his company's last quarterly update that demand for the new GPUs is ""extraordinary"" Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer Nvidia's B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs to customers .  Nvidia could beat earnings expectations and provide an optimistic outlook for the rest of the year . But if the trade dynamics change for the worse between now and May 28, that might not be enough to propel the stock higher over the near term . Over the long term, I think Nvidia's future remains bright .  Nvidia, Apple, Netflix and Netflix are all about to pop . If you invest $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you'd have $351,127! Nvidia: If you invested in Apple in 2008, you’d have $40,106! Netflix: $642,582! Now is the best time to buy before it's too late .  The Motley Fool has invested in Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia . Nvidia stock is up for sale at the end of May 28 .",positive,"gpus, nvidia, gpu, earnings, stock"
" Amazon's two growth segments can help propel it to a $10 trillion market cap . Compared to other big tech competitors, it has more room to expand profit margins in the next decade . Amazon's dual growth engines and profit margin expansion potential have the company poised to be the first stock to eclipse a $100 trillion valuation .  Amazon's combined North America and international sales were more than $500 billion over the last year . E-commerce is still less than 20% of retail sales in the United States and has steadily grown for decades . Cloud computing is getting supercharged by artificial intelligence (AI), which is taking the industry to become much bigger .  Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is going to capture the majority of the company's planned $100 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 . I think AWS has a clear path to expand to $200 billion and eventually $300 billion in revenue over the next decade and beyond .  Amazon's combined revenue will eventually reach $2 trillion in the next 10 to 20 years . Amazon's competitors in big tech do not have the large addressable market afforded to Amazon by dominating both e-commerce and cloud computing . Amazon has a much clearer revenue growth path to help it achieve the hundreds of billions of dollars in annual earnings needed to warrant this valuation .  Amazon stock is my bet to be the first stock with a $10 trillion market value . Now is the best time to buy before it’s too late . Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, available when you joinStock Advisor .  Amazon will be Wall Street's first $10 Trillion company, and it's not Apple .

" Apple could be looking to reinvent its Safari search engine through AI . The iPhone maker does significant manufacturing abroad, especially in China, the current administration's favorite tariff target . Even so, Apple's large installed base grants it plenty of lucrative monetization opportunities .  According to court testimony from Apple executive Eddy Cue, Apple may be planning to integrate artificial intelligence into its Safari search capabilities . Cue's testimony was part of an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet, whose dominance in search and longstanding partnership with Apple have generated billions for the Google parent company .

" Computex kicks off Monday in Taipei, Taiwan, for years a showcase for cutting-edge AI chips and companies lining up to buy them . This year's event may well be on another far bigger personality: US President Donald Trump . Executives this time are likely grappling with the uncertainty of the Trump administration’s .  This year’s exhibition will of course feature the hardware required to bring artificial intelligence to life . But while they tout new products onstage, these companies are also confronting profound questions about the US administration's tariff regime . Trump wants manufacturing back home.

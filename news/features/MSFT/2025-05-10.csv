" A decade ago, when Microsoft Corp. was reined in by the Justice Department, a prominent Silicon Valley attorney popularized a theory about antitrust cases: “The trial is the remedy” The theory meant forcing a monopolist to defend its conduct could open up space for other companies to innovate . And today, it's happening with Alphabet Inc.’s Google .  Apple’s top dealmaker Eddy Cue said Apple is “actively looking at” revamping its Safari web browser to focus on AI-powered search engines . His comments indicate that while Google has worked to protect its core search business, AI companies have succeeded in building a viable alternative for answering questions on the internet .  The whole point of monopolization trials “is to shake things up,” Wu says . The second phase of the Google trial focused on how to address what a federal judge last year found to be an illegal monopoly . After closing arguments May 29 and 30, Judge Amit Mehta will determine whether to break up the company .  Apple had partnered with Google on online search since 2003, earning as much as $20 billion a year for making Google’s search engine the default option on its devices . Cue was intimately involved in negotiating that deal – in fact he had testified about it in 2023 as part of the first phase of its antitrust case .  Cue barely mentioned Gemini this week when he appeared in court for the Justice Department’s second phase trial . Cue appeared to be alluding to what Silicon Valley has described as an existential threat to search over the past two years . Apple still has yet to sign a deal to add Gemini to its phones .  Users can now get instant AI-generated answers directly from bots, which are drawing their responses from large repositories of existing human-generated data . Google said it has seen an overall increase in queries from Apple devices as users switch from text-based searches to using voice-activated and image-based search .  Google discovered the key technology for the large language models that underlies today’s AI startups . The government has argued that Google didn’t capitalize on that innovation because of its dominance in the market . Google maintains that it spends billions on innovation each year and waited to introduce AI features so that it could do so responsibly .  Google is concerned that people might then use landline phones less, Wu called it ""paranoia"" Google said the company hasn't seen AI cannibalize search, with only a small slice of homework and coding queries shifting .

" Alphabet could be bigger than Microsoft or Apple if it had the same premium for its stock . Alphabet's net income is far higher than either of these two companies .

In the first quarter, $61.6 billion of its $80.5 billion in revenue came from advertising-related sources . The market views this as a potential liability, as advertising budgets tend to get cut during an economic downturn . Still, Alphabet's situation is hardly different from that of Apple, as Apple relies on sales of consumer electronics .

Lobbyists representing tech companies that announced US investments have made similar claims to congressional aides and lawmakers .

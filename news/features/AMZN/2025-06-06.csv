Nvidia is poised to be the biggest beneficiary of several artificial intelligence (AI) trends, notably including the rapid adoption of AI agents that can reason . The restrictions on AI chip exports to China will hurt its growth to some extent . I don't think this headwind will keep Nvidia from becoming much larger over the next decade .

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is pacing $117 billion in annual run-rate revenue . AWS entered 2025 accounting for a 33% share of global cloud infrastructure service spending . Amazon's other high-growth ancillary segments are playing key roles in its growth .

TSMC is in the process of increasing its CoWoS capacity from around 35,000 units per month in 2024 to 135,000 wafers per month by 2026 .

" Huang Lun was one of the original architects of his Guangzhou-based company’s push into the US market . Huang was tasked with finding new markets in Europe and Australia to soften the inevitable tariffs on Chinese imports .  China, US consumers’ appetite for cheap clothing, electronics, toys and homeware, and a “de minimis” exemption on import taxes for low-value packages . To mitigate the risk, Chinese e-commerce platforms are shifting resources to Europe and other markets, spending heavily on promotions to try to woo European consumers .  When the Trump administration announced 145% tariffs on Chinese imports and cancelled the de minimis exemption, the company initially dropped its sales targets for the US . But soon after, Huang was pulled back to work part-time on the American market again . ""We feel the US market is back, at least for this year,"" Huang said .  Shein, Temu and TikTok turned to the same tactics they used to build their markets in the US . Both platforms have offered to pay part or all of the shipping costs to European markets, as well as directly shipping costs .  Six Chinese merchants selling on Temu, Shein, TikTok and Amazon say they have found the experience frustrating . Temu had offered €2.99 ($3.38) in subsidies on orders below €30, while TikTok was willing to subsidize sales via its newly-launched UK store .  Chen started selling in the US via his own website after tariff announcements . He expects other Chinese merchants will come to the same conclusion . Chen: “In this highly-fragmented market, there’s nowhere to generate such fat profits as people do in the huge single market like the US.”  EU and UK typically have more rules on product standards and consumer protections than the US . European regulators have already begun cracking down on Temu .  The US’ tariffs on China and the end of the de minimis rule has increased a sense of urgency in the EU . In 2024, about 4.6 billion parcels valued at €150 or less entered the bloc, almost double the 2023 total .  Darmstadt Regional Council tested 800 products from Asian e-commerce platforms . 95% of them didn’t meet European standards . Among the products were laser pointers that exceeded legal output limits by up to 300 times .  The EU is in the process of reviewing stricter rules and the elimination of the €150 de minimis customs duty exemption . Other potential solutions under discussion at the Commission include introducing a handling fee for e-commerce platforms and implementing a digital product passport .  Exports of ‘low-value” parcels from China to the UK rose 53% in April, according to an analysis of China’s customs trade database . Parcels under the £135 threshold generally pass through customs with limited inspection .  Shein says it is investing $15 million this year in product safety and compliance initiatives . Half of UK sales expected to come from local sellers and warehouses by 2025 . AliExpress did not respond to a request for comment .  The Labour government announced a review of its de minimis policy in late April . So far, retailers and trade groups say there isn’t much evidence that dumping is happening .  Chinese online platforms unlikely to see complexity in developed economies as insurmountable barrier, says IMD Business School dean of Asia . Temu has begun to explore different business models, including working with small businesses .  It will be challenging to build in Europe the “proximity with the consumer” that the platforms have achieved in the US, Greeven said . It could take a year or more to figure out how to navigate tariffs and tailor their offering to European markets .  The timing of any short-term shift to Europe will be dictated by the US tariff numbers . When tariffs were set at 54% that was the point most exporters couldn’t make a profit, Wang said . future of US tariff regime is uncertain .  Mark Zuckerberg Loves MAGA Now.

" Palantir Technologies has been one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 over the last year . The software developer has seen its stock soar by 361% over the past year . Investors should look closely at the company's valuation trends .  Palantir's market capitalization has risen from about $46 billion to more than $250 billion in just one year . As of this writing, the company's price-to-sales ratio (P/S) is about 91 . The company's P/S ratio reached a record high during the dot-com bubble .  Palantir's P/S is now more than double what some leading tech players have traded at during periods of pronounced stock market euphoria . Investors still need to consider what happened in the fallout from the dot-com boom and more recent trends in the AI arena to get a better understanding of where the stock may be headed .  Amazon is a much more valuable enterprise today than it was 26 years ago during the dot-com boom . While Cisco's valuation never fully recovered, the company's current market cap of $236 billion is still far greater than the mid-2000s . Nvidia's market cap is more than twice what it was just two years ago, when its P/S peaked at around 46 .  Palantir Technologies could eclipse its current market value of $250 billion eventually . However, there is also evidence suggesting that it will be trading at more reasonable prices for new buyers at some point . For investors who want to build a position in it now, I think the best strategy to use would be dollar-cost averaging .

" Nvidia shares have gotten less expensive, but another big AI player has an even better valuation . The big question is when or even if there will be an adequate return on those investments . Nvidia chips are filling server stacks in many data centers being built globally .  Nvidia's stock has been under pressure as questions surface about demand from a slowdown in AI infrastructure spending .

Even if capital spending on data center buildouts does slow, that doesn't present the full picture either . Taking that broader view should make most investors comfortable owning both Nvidia and TSMC at recent valuations .  If you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $614,911!

" Amazon launched its first complete payload of Kuiper internet satellites on April 28 . Amazon says it will begin satellite internet service for customers this year . I'm skeptical .  It took SpaceX 15 months to move from initial testing of its own experimental Starlink satellites to kicking off full-scale production . Amazon finally launched its first batch of operational Kuipersats aboard another ULA Atlas V. Last week's launch was roughly a year behind schedule .  SpaceX has more than 7,100 Starlinks in orbit, generating billions in annual revenue . Most Starlinks going up are V2 Mini models, significantly upgraded from the original Starlink . Amazon is now in a race against time to get 50% of its constellation (1,618 satellites) completed by a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) deadline that tolls on July 30, 2026 .  Amazon's Kuipersats orbit higher than SpaceX's Starlinks . Each Kuipersat can cover more square footage down on Earth than can an equivalent Starlink . Amazon has to buy up all the rocket rides all around the world for the next year or three to get its constellation completed .  Amazon says it plans to begin beta service later this year, but it's building fewer than 1,618 satellites . The company says it wants to launch five Kuipersats a day, but the Wall Street Journal says it's currently building only one a day . Amazon is hoping to get at least beta service up and running by July 30, 2026, hoping this will be enough to convince FCC to extend license .  Amazon.com.com is one of the fastest growing companies in the world . The company has been in the news for more than a decade . Amazon is the world's biggest tech giant, but it's not easy to predict .  Amazon launches 27 Satellites in First Challenge to SpaceX and Starlink .

The company is set to report quarterly results on Thursday, May 15th . It will be interesting to see if the stock can maintain its performance momentum after the results .  Management touched on some of these trends in its April 9th investor day event, noting some near-term tariff-related challenges . Walmart has been coming ahead of its target over the last two years, with sales up +5.5% and operating income up +9.5%.  Walmart’s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households . Management indicated their commitment to maintain price advantage over rivals . Walmart is expected to report $0.58 in EPS on $165.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes .  Same-store sales (ex-fuel) are expected to be up +3.21% for the quarter, compared to +4.9% in the preceding period . Target's Q1 earnings season scorecard now has results from 20 of the 33 retailers in the S&P 500 index .

Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart is a growing online vendor .

Q1 EPS beats percentage of 73.7% for the companies that have reported already comparing to the average for the same group of 78% over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years) Q1 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 452 S&P 500 members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, the expectation is that earnings will be up +12.3% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues . The chart below shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for 2025 Q1 in the context of where growth has been .  We noted in recent weeks that estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been coming down . The magnitude of cuts to 2025 Q2 estimates since the start of the period is bigger and more widespread relative to what we have become used to seeing in the post-COVID period . But we are starting to notice a curious development with the Tech sector estimate, both for Q2 as well as full-year 2025 .  Tech sector’s evolving earnings expectations for full-year 2025 have also increased in annual estimates as well . If trend continues for a few more weeks, it will be hard to interpret this development as a sign that the earnings picture has clearly stabilized and started to strengthen .  Tech sector estimates have come under pressure in recent weeks, with the negative revisions trend becoming very meaningful and widespread since mid-February 2025 . But upward revisions to tech sector estimates is starting to show up in full-year estimates, causing a reversal in the negative revision trend .  Zacksacksacks.

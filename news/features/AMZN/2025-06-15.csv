" William Tunstall-Pedoe started pushing the boundaries on what's possible with machines as a 13-year-old schoolboy . He secretly helped create and launch Amazon’s Alexa over a decade ago . His anagram technology was used by author Dan Brown for the Da Vinci Code .  It is 20 years since he started his search and voice recognition company, True Knowledge . Evi Technologies was sold to Amazon in 2012 for a reported £21m . Tunstall-Pedoe charts the company as a 10-year adventure .  Evi pivoted several times as a start-up, from a search engine that answered questions to producing a voice assistant, launching at the same time as Apple’s Siri . Evi was tackling the problem of how to use language to interact with machines, which of course is incredibly topical now .  Unlikely AI is developing technology that combines LLMs with symbolic methods to make AI safer for companies in sectors such as healthcare . 30-strong Cambridge outfit had multiple acquisition offers before working on secret project for Amazon, now known as Alexa, which went to market in late 2014 .  Thus Unlikely AI was born to earn trust and solve complex issues with its deep learning software . Tunstall-Pedoe says LLMs are designed to be accurate and explainability and auditability .  I built a database of millions of facts about the world, where the system could make sense and reason with them . I thought it would be interesting to do an analysis of all the facts that the system knew, and in particular with the goal of finding what the least interesting date in history was — 11 April 1954 . The story went so viral that it got told and retold and it’s had new life ever since .  You can have 100 million users within a couple of months if you create a really successful piece of software, which is kind of almost impossible in almost any other industry . That's what's exciting about it, that potential for big impact if you're developing technology that really hits home .",neutral,"alexa, ai, siri, assistant, evi"

" Apple is considering using AI technology from Anthropic PBC or OpenAI to power a new version of Siri . The iPhone maker has talked with both companies about using their large language models for Siri . It has asked them to train versions of their models that could run on Apple’s cloud infrastructure for testing .  The company currently powers most of its AI features with homegrown technology that it calls Apple Foundation Models . A switch to Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI’s ChatGPT models for Siri would be an acknowledgment that the company is struggling to compete in generative AI .  The project to evaluate external models was started by Siri chief Mike Rockwell and software engineering head Craig Federighi . They were given oversight of Siri after the duties were removed from the command of John Giannandrea, the company’s AI chief .  Anthropic's technology is most promising for Siri’s needs, people said . The Siri assistant has fallen behind popular AI chatbots . Apple's attempts to upgrade the software have been stymied by engineering snags and delays .  Apple has already approved a multibillion dollar budget for 2026 for running its own models via the cloud but its plans for beyond that remain murky . Executives have grown increasingly open to the idea that embracing outside technology is the key to a near-term turnaround .  Apple considered acquiring Perplexity in order to bolster its AI work, Bloomberg has reported . The company is working on a series of projects, including a tabletop robot and glasses that will make heavy use of AI .  Meta Platforms Inc. and OpenAI are offering some of the AI industry’s most in-demand talent . Apple is known to pay its AI engineers half of what they can get on the open market .  The iPhone maker requested a custom version of Claude and ChatGPT that could run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers . Apple believes that running the models on its own chips housed in Apple-controlled cloud servers will better safeguard user privacy .  Apple is opening up the on-device models to third-party developers later this year . The company hasn't announced plans to give apps access to the cloud models . The cloud servers don’t have the capacity to handle a flood of new features .  Apple and Anthropic have disagreed over preliminary financial terms . The AI startup is seeking a multibillion-dollar annual fee that increases sharply each year . The struggle to reach a deal has left Apple contemplating working with OpenAI .  Apple killed the project — announced last year as Swift Assist — about a month ago . The company later this year is rolling out a new Xcode that can tap into third-party programming models .

" Amazon is a dark horse pick to become the largest company in the world in a few years . Its investment thesis centers on profit growth, rather than revenue growth . Amazon is more than just the e-commerce platform you interact with when shopping .  Advertising is Amazon's fourth-largest segment, behind online stores, third-party seller services, and Amazon Web Services . It's also the fastest-growing segment, with revenue rising 18% in the first quarter . Amazon has some of the most valuable consumer data available, like direct information about shopping habits .  AWS' cloud computing segment is benefiting from two major trends: a migration from on-premises to cloud-based solutions and the increasing adoption of AI workloads . Although it accounted for 19% of overall revenue, it contributed 63% of the company's total operating profits .  Amazon is valued around the same level as Microsoft and Nvidia, so it doesn't have an argument for seeing its price-to-forward-earnings multiple increase over the next few years . I don't think Amazon's 20% or so operating profit growth will enable it to surpass Nvidia, which is rising at a significantly faster rate . Regardless, I believe Amazon is an excellent investment,and it will likely deliver market-beating returns .

Sonya Gafsi Oblisk, who became Whole Foods’ chief merchandising and marketing officer in 2023, will take over from Karen Christensen .  Amazon veteran Anand Varadarajan will lead technology and supply chain . Whole Foods veterans Bill Jordan and Christina Minardi are also listed under the new Worldwide Grocery leadership team .  As of June 16, Bob Lockett took over as Schnuck Markets’ chief people officer . Lockett will head up team benefits, talent acquisition and retention, labor relations, training and development . Prior to Schnucks, Lockett held the same position at CAE and, before that, was chief diversity officer at ADP .  Krasdale Foods announced at the start of the month that it promoted Corporate Controller Rob Gangemi to vice president of finance . Gangemi has helped develop more efficient and automated reconciliation of reports and created monthly updates for the CFO and president .",neutral,"grocery, executive, amazon, foods, leadership"
" MercadoLibre has grown much faster than Amazon over the past 20 years . A$1,000 investment in its shares two decades ago would be worth $89,400 today . It still looks reasonably valued relative to its long-term growth potential .  MercadoLibre operates in 19 Latin American countries, though most of its customers are in Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina . It also locks in its customers with an expanding ecosystem of fintech services . From 2004 to 2024, annual revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 45% .  MercadoLibre served more than 100 million unique active buyers on its marketplace, and 60 million monthly active users . As the company expanded, economies of scale kicked in and reduced its logistics, marketing, and payment processing expenses . As a result, it turned consistently profitable in 2021 -- and its net income increased at a staggering CAGR of 184% over the following three years .  Revenue and net income to rise at CAGRs of 25% and 34%, respectively . That growth should be driven by the expansion of its fintech ecosystem . A potential spinoff of MercadoLibre's Pago could even unlock the subsidiary's value .  MercadoLibre might go through some volatile swings over the next few years, but I believe it will keep heading higher . That's why I'm still holding my shares -- even after a gain of more than 100% -- and I won't be selling them anytime soon .

" Despite Warren Buffett's massive stake in the business, Sirius XM is losing subscribers, with revenue and net income falling . Amazon has soared 12,000% in the past two decades . However, the S&P 500 index has returned 113% in that period .  Sirius XM collects a recurring revenue stream from subscriptions .

" On the face of it, 2025 looks like a banner year for crypto: Bitcoin hitting a record, an industry-boosting US president . But look beyond the bullish headlines and the rally in Bitcoin, and a vastly different landscape comes into view . Most of the so-called altcoins once touted as competitors to the original cryptoasset are nursing steep declines .  Bitcoin’s share of the total market value of cryptoassets has climbed by nine percentage points this year to 64%, the highest since January 2021 . In sharp contrast, altcoins — the catch-all term for all digital assets outside of Bitcoin — are faltering .  The bottom half of the largest 100 digital assets has given up all those gains and is down around 50% in 2025 . Bitcoin soaking up the bulk of capital flows from investors in exchange-traded funds . Even Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, remains about 50% below its all-time high .  In the past year alone, the market value of stablecoins has swelled by $47 billion . The Wall Street Journal reported this month that Amazon.com Inc. is studying a potential stablecoin .  Modeled on Michael Saylor’s Strategy, a new breed of Bitcoin accumulators has emerged . In April, a special-purpose acquisition company affiliated with Cantor Fitzgerald LP partnered with Tether Holdings SA and SoftBank to launch Twenty One Capital Inc., seeded with nearly $4 billion in Bitcoin .  The potential for US Securities and Exchange Commission approval of ETFs backed by coins like Solana are stirring hopes of wider adoption . The Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, informally referred to as crypto’s market structure bill, is also possible catalyst .  Most altcoins are stuck in a sort of twilight zone, underpinned by big promises and not much else . “I think a lot of them are going to whittle down to zero because they were driven by speculation without that mimetic value like Bitcoin,” he said .",negative,"stablecoins, altcoins, cryptocurrency, stablecoin, bitcoin"
" The digital services tax, enacted last year, would have seen US service providers such as Alphabet and Amazon on the hook for a multi-billion-dollar payment in Canada by Monday . Washington has previously requested dispute settlement talks over the tax, but on Friday Trump said he was ending trade talks with Ottawa in retaliation for the tax . The tax had been forecast to bring in Can$5.9 billion (US$4.2 billion) over five years .  Canada is the largest supplier of foreign steel and aluminum to the United States . Canada has been spared some of the sweeping duties Trump has imposed on other countries . Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has also imposed steep levies on imports of steel, aluminum and autos .  Dozens of countries face a July 9 deadline for steeper US duties to kick in . It remains to be seen if they will successfully reach agreements before the deadline .

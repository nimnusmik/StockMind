" IBM is building the first large-scale quantum computer capable of operating without errors . The computer, called Starling, is set to launch by 2029 . IBM stock hit an all-time high of $273.27 on Monday, more than the S&P 500's roughly 12% gain .  IBM’s Starling is a “significant” development for the quantum computing market, IDC quantum analyst Heather West said . Once developed, useful quantum computers would solve problems that would take “classical” computers billions of years .  IBM says Starling will be able to run large-scale quantum operations without error . Unlike traditional computers that use bits or series of 1s and 0s, quantum machines use qubits . Qubits are a function of quantum mechanics and, rather than being expressed as a 1 or 0, can exist as both at the same time, allowing for far more processing capabilities .  IBM will use a code called qLDPC requiring its quantum computers to use fewer qubits . The company says this will allow it to scale the computers without making them less accurate . Google also said it achieved this feat with its Willow chip in late 2024 .  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in January that useful quantum computing was decades away . Horvath expects “useful’s quantum computers will arrive within the next five years . Tech CEOs have previously projected longer timelines .",positive,"qubits, ibm, computing, computers, starling"
" Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 23% of its portfolio invested in two artificial intelligence stocks, Apple and Amazon .

Apple aims to monetize its installed base exceeding 2.35 billion devices with add-on services like iCloud storage, Apple Care, Apple Pay, and App Store content . Many analysts expect Apple to eventually monetize artificial intelligence .  Siri upgrades have been delayed for months despite many pundits predicting a massive upgrade cycle . Last month, Apple announced plans to open its Apple Intelligence large language models to third-party developers .  The investment thesis for Amazon centers on its strong position in three industries . Wall Street has downwardly revised estimates due to totariff uncertainty . Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud in terms of infrastructure and platform services revenue .  Morgan Stanley recently called Amazon's retail business the ""most underappreciated"" generative AI beneficiary in the technology space . The company has developed custom semiconductors for AI training and inference that offer better price performance than the leading graphics processing units .  Wall Street estimates Amazon's earnings will increase at 10% annually through 2026 . Amazon beat the consensus estimate by an average of 21% over the last six quarters .

" Amazon, Celsius, and Roku have long-term potential that investors should consider . Studies have shown that a stock's valuation is one of the biggest factors for price movements over the short term .  Amazon generated $93 billion in revenue in a single quarter (2025's Q1) The scale of its e-commerce business is absolutely massive . I'm still impressed with Amazon's ability to become more efficient and consequently more profitable . Amazon is even testing humanoid robots to aid delivery drivers .  Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing business . As of Q1, AWS was a $117 billion run-rate business, growing at a 17% pace . As artificial intelligence (AI) grows in popularity, cloud computing is more important than ever, giving Amazon stock plenty of long-term upside .  Celsius is a cash-rich, debt-free, profitable business . It recently acquired fast-growing competitor Alani Nu . It's taking greater control of its business by becoming vertically integrated . And third, it's developing a portfolio of new products, including hydration .  Amazon stock and Celsius stock are pretty close to no-brainer opportunities for long-term investors today . I don't necessarily believe that about Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU)stock right now . Roku is closing in on being used in 100 million households .  Roku stock is trading down about 25% over the last five years, but it's not due to a lack of growth . The company has diluted shareholders with its generous use of stock-based compensation for its employees . Even with its own struggles, Roku's business appears to be aptly positioned for huge ongoing shifts in advertising strategies and spending .  Whether Roku stock is a brilliant buy today is up for debate . I believe that Amazon stock and Celsius stock are much safer . But the better thing for investors to remember here is that thinking long-term, as opposed to short-term is always the more brilliant investing approach .

" AI-driven large language models gobble information in a race to dominate the web’s frontier . The latest of the AI scraping wars is between Reddit and AI startupAnthropic . Reddit claims that Anthropic intentionally scraped Reddit users' personal data without their consent .  Anthropic is also defending itself against a separate suit from music publishers . The case adds to a growing number of high-profile cases where copyright holders have tried to guard their works from the reach of technology firms .  The court rejected Ross's argument that it could use the summaries under the concept offair use, which allows copyrights to be used for news reporting, teaching, research, criticism, and commentary . The New York Times (NYT) filed a lawsuit accusing OpenAI and Microsoft of illegally using millions of published stories to train OpenAI’s language models .  Getty Images is trying to chip away at the same argument in lawsuits filed in 2023 against AI image generation startup Stability . Stability argues that fair use justified training its technology on copyrighted material .  In 2005, the Authors Guild sued Google over millions of books that the tech giant scanned and made available in “snippets” to online searchers . Google didn’t pay for the copyrighted information but did provide word-for-word pieces of the copyrighted works in search results . The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reasoned in adecision that Google’s scanning project tested the limits of fair use but was “transformative” and therefore protected under fair use law .  Google could be drawn into the new AI scraping wars as part of a landmark antitrust case against Google’s Search monopoly that was won last year by the US Justice Department . The DOJ has argued that the search giant could further entrench its dominance by training its AI model, Gemini, on its vast index of internet content .",negative,"copyrights, lawsuits, copyright, lawsuit, sued"

Amazon's AI business presents massive opportunties, and the company's stock is trading at an attractive price .  Many investors know that Buffett loves an undervalued stock . But when explaining how he chooses stocks, he calls himself a business picker, not a stock picker . Buffett: ""I didn't go into Apple because it was a tech stock in the least""  Buffett first bought shares of Apple stock in 2016 and built up his position for a few years before selling about half of it last year . When he first bought it, Buffett said that he owned about 5% of shares outstanding but expected that to increase to about 6% to 7% through Apple's share-buyback program .

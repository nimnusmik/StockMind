" Tim Vanderhook; Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer; Viant Technology Inc . Lawrence Madden; Chief Financial Officer . Nicholas Zangler; Vice President, Investor Relations . Analyst; Analyst; Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Matthew Condon; JMP Securities Christopher Kuntarich; analyst; UBS Maria Ripps; Analyst .  Viant Technology's first-quarter 2025 earnings conference call . On the call today are Tim Vanderhook, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer . Chris Vanderhook and Larry Madden, Chief Financial Officer .  Viant will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures during the call . Please refer to the risks and uncertainties described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 .  Revenue increased 32% year over year and contribution ex-TAC increased 25% . Strong top line growth was driven by continued CTV demand, increased use of Viant's addressability solutions .  Year to date, through April, ad spend across our platform has been strong . Year over year growth rates for revenue and contribution ex-TAC increased in each month throughout the first quarter with the strongest performance observed in March .  We serve a broad and diversified group of well over 1,000 advertisers, spanning all major industry verticals . No one advertiser represents more than 5% of the total ad spend on the platform . We anticipate recently imposed tariffs will only minimally impact our future performance .  Three digital channels represented over 50% of our total ad spend on our platform in 2024, up from 43% in 2023 and 40% in 2022 . In CTV, our Direct Access program provides advertisers with a streamlined path to premium inventory .  CTV was the strongest driver of top line growth in the quarter . Over 55% of CTV spend is now running through our Direct Access premium publishers, which uniquely connects advertisers directly to premium CTV inventory .  Direct Access will continue to attract incremental CTV spend to our platform, enabling Viant to maintain market leading CTV growth . We believe the DSP that wins in CTV will win across all other open web digital channels .  Viant's Household ID, our patented audience targeting and measurement solution, is experiencing unprecedented demand . Household ID boasts availability across roughly 80% of biddable ad inventory, significantly exceeding other identifiers .  IRIS_ID allows advertisers to target CTV ad inventory at the video level, enabling them to align their brand, product, or service with contextually relevant content . Paramount, Lionsgate Films, CNN, and TCL among others are newly-minted IRIS-enabled publishers .  IRIS_ID continues to win adoption among publishers, advertisers gain the ability to deploy contextual campaigns at greater scale . AI Bidding now automates 85% of the ad spending on our platform, up from 80% in Q4 2024 .  In the third quarter of 2024, we launched AI Planning, which enables advertisers to create enterprise-level ad campaigns in seconds . We expect to launch AI Measurement and Analysis in the second half of 2025 .  ViantAI is fully transparent, providing advertisers with detailed insights into their campaign data, including publisher allocation, clearing prices, return on ad spend metrics . Viant is well positioned for long-term growth as these market dynamics evolve .  DOJ is pursuing remedies that could include a divestiture of both the DoubleClick assets and Google AdX . If these assets are spun off into an independent entity, it is reasonable to expect this new supply-side platform to seek out incremental demand through additional partnerships with third-party DSPs beyond Google's DV360 .  Christopher Vanderhook: Big Tech attribution misrepresentation and the emerging opportunity to win incremental ad spend from data-driven advertisers diverting spend from search and social . The investor misperception that Amazon is a material threat to open Internet DSPs.  Advertisers have been misled by attribution misrepresentation, say experts . CTV sparks consumer demand, and display, search, and social channels merely navigate the consumer to the point of purchase .  Viant's measurement solutions offer advertisers the ability to measure incremental lift, which is now the most requested measurement feature on our platform . Demand for this feature has in part powered a 500% increase in Household ID-powered ad spending over the last two years .  Search, social, and other forms of display advertising will come under pressure as advertisers prioritize more effective ad channels like CTV . Viant has a significant opportunity to win ad spend from advertisers overinvested in search and social .  ViantAI is building detailed media plans and manages continuous bidding for advertisers . We have stripped away the complexities of a traditional DSP, removing the primary barrier, which has prohibited smaller data-driven advertisers from accessing the open Internet .  Viant is to release a completely autonomous DSP by the end of the year . We believe the displacement of search and social and prioritization of CTV as the cornerstone of ad campaign strategy will draw data-driven advertisers to Viant .  Amazon can undermine effectiveness of competing streaming services by directing spend to Amazon Prime Video . Rarely have we ever encountered Amazon DSP in an RFP process . Publishers reluctant to provide Amazon with addressable signals, be it audience or contextual identifiers, as doing so could incidentally strengthen the Amazon Identity Graph .  Investors are quick to point to the quality of Amazon's first-party data as a potential threat . While highly effective within Amazon's walled garden, its usefulness is limited across the open Internet . Netflix, Disney, and Paramount are not willing to provide Amazon, a competing streaming service .  Viant is arguably the only completely independent and objective enterprise-level self-service DSP that exists in the marketplace . We plan to continue to fend off Big Tech behemoths, including Amazon, through independence and our focus on our three strategic priorities .  Revenue for the first quarter was $70.6 million, representing a 32% increase year over year . Contribution ex-TAC totaled $42.7 million in Q1, up 25% compared to the prior year period and also above the high end of our guidance range . Larry Madden will provide more detail on our financial performance .  We saw a 37% increase in the number of percent of spend customers generating over $1 million in contribution ex-TAC . We delivered strong performance across most customer verticals in Q1 . Healthcare, consumer goods, and business services led the way .  Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $37.3 million for the quarter, reflecting a 20% year over year increase and flat sequentially . Video, inclusive of CTV, represented 62% of total platform spend in the quarter .  Organic non-GAAP operating expenses increased 14% year over year and declined 2% sequentially . Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 was $5.4 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance by more than 27% .  Non-GAAP net income totaled $2.8 million for the quarter, up 109% from $1.3 million in the prior year . Cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $8.2 million, representing a 30% year over year increase .  We used $22.7 million in cash for financing activities during the quarter, including $17 million for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $3.2 million for taxes related to the net settlement of equity awards . Since initiating our $50 million share repurchase program, we have returned $46.5 million to shareholders .  Our solid financial foundation, combined with disciplined execution and strategic capital allocation, positions us exceptionally well to capture the significant market opportunity ahead . We view these shifts as temporary and timing driven, not indicative of reduced spend commitments or structural weakness . The majority of the spend is expected to be realized in the second half of 2025 .  Our guide assumes record Q2 performance across all metrics: spend, revenue, CXT and adjusted EBITDA, despite macroeconomic headwinds .  Christopher Vanderhook: We believe we are well positioned to navigate near-term macroeconomic headwinds while continuing to capitalize on secular tailwinds, including CTV, addressability, and ViantAI .  Direct Access. program continues to be a great selling proposition. The fact that we do not take fees, we're eliminating a lot of middlemen fees in there. So if a marketer wants to buy CTV, they're going to do that through Direct Access . The scale of our Household ID just continues to pay big dividends to marketers .  There was a lot of uncertainty in the market, but marketers quickly responded . We believe that marketers have become much more resilient just over the past . The kind of fake economic recession or worries of economic recession in late '22 caused a little bit of a headwind to ad spend, but it quickly came back in 2023 .  There is uncertainty of tariffs, where they're going to land, who they affect, how they'll handle pricing of their goods to consumers . So I know that there's a lot of scenario planning going. Tim Vanderhook A lot of what-ifs.  Christopher Vanderhook: It's a big sea change from the enormous wall of money that's been spent towards last-touch attribution . He says more of the sophisticated advertiser set is moving towards this move towards allocating spend based on incrementality . Vanderhook says it's really just an education process while marketers understand that new path .  Share of spend on our platform in the last quarter here reach 45% in CTV . That is much higher as a percentage of mix of mix -- versus competitors . The reason is that their default measurement of choice is still last-touch attribution .  The CTV on average with our -- and this is other data that's out there, not just in ours. But on average, it has a 200% incremental lift compared to other formats and channels. If you look at search, social, and much of display advertising, that's in the mid-single digits to low-double digits of incrementality .  Google launched something that appears to be akin to your Household ID, or at least they're implementing IP addresses into their DSP, into DV360 . Christopher Vanderhook: We're highly confident in that. They may be taking some investment out of the second quarter, but they are replacing it. And so we already see that in platform and where it's scheduled.  Household ID is focused on people-based identifiers where an IP address is a digital identifier that is out there with cookies . Christopher Vanderhook says Household ID does not represent IP address .  Google has eradicated IP addresses in AdX, but they are still not passing that through the AdX ecosystem . On one hand, it's good. But nonetheless, IP addresses, just in general, are probably not the most useful. A lot of times you get an IP address that comes across is a server side IP .  The IP address, Google has it on 100% . A lot of platforms like a Roku run through a proxy, so you can't look at those . So it's not a panacea by any means, but certainly, it's much different than our Household ID .  April was strong persistent growth. versus how you were thinking about it at the beginning of the year? Christopher Vanderhook: It was within that range. But typically, what we see as we did in Q1, where we build month-over-month. So we started out the quarter strong. We did have this little -- the pause or the moving of some money from Q2 to the second half .  As we said on our last call, our pipeline has never been stronger. We're getting much larger looks at bigger pieces of business, meaning larger and larger advertisers . We're pretty -- we feel very bullish on the back half in terms of new customer pipeline .  IRIS_ID, we just had a good handful of -- even in the first quarter of pretty good-sized Fortune 500 brands shifting spend . We see great results there. And the last one, I'll say, will be in the second half that's going to contribute is .  Lawrence Madden: Overall, I think for the year, you're talking 16%, 17% growth . It does -- included in them -- that is about 500 basis points relating to the acquisitions . Christopher Vanderhook: On the public sector, what are you seeing across your Public Sector vertical?  Maria Ripps: We don't believe we have a lot of exposure to automotive. verticals . Within retail, as we said, we saw some small impact . Public services has been consistent. It was a big growth -- really big growth driver for us a couple of quarters ago .  Any difference in economics for you between Direct Access CTV and other CTV spend? Christopher Vanderhook Well, we don't charge a fee for Direct Access . It's a benefit to marketers when we can connect directly with content owners .  IRIS continues to add to our scale and Household ID and also with IRIS_ID . We're making and continuing to reinforce Direct Access program has a lot of benefits, not just cost savings to marketers, and that's why they keep spending more .  80% of the money, we believe, that is in digital advertising is spent based on last touch attribution, meaning whoever showed the last ad right before a consumer purchase, gets all the credit for it and the money flows that way .  Marketing organizations are completely built around these KPIs in digital advertising . CMOs understand that TV drives impact and maybe a branded search term isn't responsible for incremental sales, but they keep buying it, and you have to ask why .  Tim Vanderhook: It's not just us, but it is something that we have to continue to educate in the industry around. But we think that this is definitely changing. Meta came out and open source their model for incrementalities because so many advertisers are asking to measure incrementality versus the old traditional cost per customer acquisition.  Some margin expansion of EBITDA as a percentage of contribution ex-TAC? Is that something you still see at this point? Lawrence Madden Absolutely. For the year, we expect that to be the case. Our guidance is they're roughly equal in this quarter .  Google controls traffic at the start of the Internet journey for most consumers . They push that traffic wherever they want, usually to their owned and operated businesses . Short of a breakup, there is no stopping that machine from going through .  The only solution for future monopolies from the government to do is to break them up, says Mauricio Munoz . He says short of a breakup, it would have absolutely no impact because they can continue to use the cash flow of business A to subsidize business B until the market participants are gone .  Larry Madden, Lawrence Madden, Tim Vanderhook and Lawrence Vanderhook discussed the impact of the pushout . Mauricio Alberto Munoz Roldan asked if you could quantify the impact in your second quarter guidance . And from a customer perspective, was this driven by your larger customers or the long tail of your small advertiser base?  Amazon is looking to expand share at price points, Mauricio Alberto Munoz Roldan asked . Maybe you can talk about the defensibility of Viant if other scale DSPs were to come down market and start competing with you for more of the mid- to smaller advertising and agency opportunity .  Amazon's data set is very, very strong, probably second to none out there. But if you look at other verticals like automotive, quick service restaurants, travel and tourism, the data set that Amazon possesses has no benefit to that vertical category, and they have no position of strength there .  Amazon DSP is going to be a really good partner for you and probably already is in critical to your success . But if you're in financial services, automotive, quick service restaurants, even at the Fortune 500 level, Mauricio says, their data set has no value to your business overall .  Much of what we see even right now is really Amazon going around trying because they've under-delivered with their upfront commitments . Because viewership is down in Prime Video outside of a few big franchises like Thursday Night Football, they're trying to place those ads somewhere .  Christopher Vanderhook: We are moving upmarket within what we still want to call the mid-market. A mid-markets advertiser spends between $50 million and up to $1 billion a year in advertising. So we are getting bigger swings at larger accounts, certainly. One of the -- yes, there are -- there's always [groans] of any time -- and if you hear where there's inefficient pricing, you hear .  Nat Geo doesn't charge for things like Direct Access because I don't need to . We are widely noted as being more efficient from a pricing standpoint compared to larger DSPs . Nat Geo may offer other pricing mechanisms that aren't fixed cost, but maybe are value-based pricing .  Around the competitor that you mentioned, what around -- the Trade Desk, what people are sick of is the incremental fees, not so much the platform fee . We really don't play that game, though, of trying to go tit-for-tat on pricing. We price what we think is fair. We try and not charge as many incremental fees as the other customers .  Amazon's lack of nickel and diming kind of as you brought up, that has been a problem, particularly at the large agency side . I know that in the end, though, what's going to matter is the total percentage of the dollars that are being taken by the ad tech stack .  We believe in the mid-market that they are much more data-driven than in the Fortune 100 . A lot of them don't have a heavy reliance on e-commerce . They're not doing monthly and quarterly planning, looking at incremental return on ad spend as much .  There's huge infrastructure costs that someone like The Trade Desk or Google has to carry to support the large holding companies, which is operations in 40 countries or 30 countries . Those international operations are all money losers, absolute money losers .  The ad spend across those 39 other countries, besides the US, doesn't support the staff that's required to be there . And this is always why our strategic perspective was to stay on US national advertisers, what we call the mid-market, and focus on there because we hit operating leverage in our business model .",neutral,"gaap, quarterly, earnings, revenue, enterprise"

" Nvidia dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, resulting in soaring revenue in recent quarters . Investors have worried about how upcoming U.S. tariffs on imports may hurt the economy -- and demand for Nvidia’s products .  President Donald Trump announced a plan to put in place a set of tariffs on imports from around the world . The concern is this will increase prices of items at home, weighing on consumers' wallets and companies' earnings . This potential hurdle put Nvidia to a test: Would its top customers, seeing the risk of a slowdown ahead, cut spending on AI .  Trump's initial tariff plan was put on pause to offer countries time to negotiate trade deals with the U.S. The president has temporarily exempted electronics products from the tariffs . It's too early to determine this impact, since final tariff levels haven't been set . The tech giants all face a certain degree of impact on future earnings prospects .  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella: Cloud and AI are essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth . Amazon said it continues to ""invest very aggressively in AI"" Alphabet reiterated that it plans $75 billion in capital spending this year and said its relationship with Nvidia is a ""key advantage""  Top customers refuse to slow down their AI spending plans, even against a tumultuous economic backdrop . This means we should expect ongoing growth from Nvidia as these customers continue to seek out top-performing chips .

" Jeff Bezos recently adopted a plan that would allow him to sell as much as 25 million shares of Amazon . Bezos could very well be selling because he thinks Amazon's stock is overvalued or facing an uphill battle . Selling stock does not necessarily mean that someone is bearish, because insiders often sell stock if they need the money for purchase .  Bezos has sold a lot of stock, about $30 billion worth, since founding the company and taking it public . Many speculated he was trolling or having fun, but since then, shares of Amazon have rocketed higher .  Amazon recently reported earnings that weren't necessarily good but failed to excite investors . Amazon Web Services revenue in the quarter grew 17% year over year but came in slightly below Wall Street analysts . CEO Andy Jassy seemed confident on the company's earnings call that Amazon could handle whatever comes its way .  Even after the sell-off this year, Amazon's stock is still up a whopping 86% since May of 2023 . The odds of a recession in the U.S. are certainly much higher than they have been in recent years .

" By one projection, artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a $15.7 trillion boost to the worldwide economy by 2030 . Nvidia has been the AI revolution's most-direct beneficiary . Five dominant companies with foundational operating segments have the tools and intangibles to surpass Nvidia's market cap by 2028 .  Nvidia's valuation climbed from $360 billion to end 2022 to well north of $3 trillion in less than two years . Nvidia's Hopper (H100) graphics processing unit (GPU) and next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture have been the preferred chips .  If an AI bubble were to form and burst, it would undoubtedly hit Nvidia stock hard . Competition is mounting in the AI-GPU space -- albeit from an unlikely source . I'd expect these headwinds to weigh down Nvidia stock over the coming three years .  Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounted for a third of all cloud infrastructure service spend during the fourth quarter of 2024 . More importantly, it's growing by a high-teens percentage on a year-over-year basis . Amazon's other high-growth ancillary segments include advertising services .  Amazon has the tools to generate outsized cash flow growth over the next three-to-five years . Google Cloud is incorporating artificial intelligence to give its clients access to generative AI solutions and large language model tools .  Meta Platforms is an ad-driven business -- even more so than Alphabet . No other social media company is particularly close to attracting the 3.43 billion daily active people that Meta averaged in March 2025 .  Payment facilitator Visa has the necessary catalysts to leapfrog Nvidia, when combined with the latter's headwinds . Visa's sustained double-digit sales and earnings growth rate is a function of its being the dominant player in payment processing domestically . The company is also sitting on an enviable treasure chest of capital .  Visa has the capital and cash flow to organically or acquisitively enter faster-growing (and chronically underbanked) emerging markets . If Berkshire Hathaway stuck to this trajectory, it could become a $2 trillion company by the midpoint of 2028 .  Warren Buffett loves putting Berkshire's cash to work in companies with robust capital-return programs . Berkshire Hathaway should have no trouble collecting in excess of $5 billion in dividend income over the next year . Relying on dividend stocks suggests Berkshire's investment portfolio is going to outperform over the long run .  Now is the best time to buy before it’s too late, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon .

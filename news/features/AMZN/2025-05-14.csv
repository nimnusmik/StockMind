" Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been a disappointing stock over the past year . Since May 2024, AMD has been down almost 32% . AMD has also struggled with a lack of competitiveness in absorbing that demand .  The first five months of 2025 have been marked by growing uncertainty around demand for infrastructure chips . Super Micro Computer recently posted results with a weaker-than-expected outlook for the upcoming quarter, citing delays in AI server orders .  Big Tech companies are increasingly buying chips directly from manufacturers like Nvidia and AMD, and building AI systems in-house, bypassing integrators like SMCI . The market remains skeptical about infrastructure chipmakers, especially AMD .  Most of the current AI buildout is GPU-driven, rather than focused on traditional CPUs . AMD is effectively left with pent-up demand, which it hasn't been able to unlock . As a result, AMD continues to lag behind NVIDIA in absorbing the surging demand for AI infrastructure .  AMD is currently priced near the lowest levels seen in the last three years, having hit a low of 19x just a few weeks ago . That’sa significant drop from its peak multiple of 63x in Q1 of last year . The lower multiple suggests AMD could be de-risked enough to justify a bullish thesis, but it also reflects investors’ hesitation to pay a premium for its long-term story .  AMD is trading at a PEG ratio of 0.8x, making it look even cheaper relative to growth . For short-term traders looking to navigate AMD’s high volatility, which amounts to around 45% annually, a more tactical approach is key . I suggest a strategy based on moving average crossovers—specifically watching fora bullish signal when the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day .  AMD recently posted a decent quarter, but it comes amid some paradoxes in the AI infrastructure chip market . AMD’s valuation may appear more de-risked than in years, but I would still wait for more explicit confirmation of a bullish trend before initiating a long position .",negative,"amd, cpus, chipmakers, gpu, micro"

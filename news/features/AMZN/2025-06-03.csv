" Shopify is one of the reasons Amazon’s highest-growth days are in the rearview mirror . The used car market is surprisingly fragmented, waiting for a player like Carvana to continue adding efficiency by scaling up .  Shopify helps brands establish and manage their own e-commerce presence . The company doesn't disclose its customer count any longer, somewhere on the order of 5 million stores sold a confirmed $292.3 billion worth of goods and services last year . That figure translates to $8.9 billion in revenue and $1.1 billion in net income .  Analysts expect a similar growth rate for at least the next several years . The U.S. Census Bureau reports that only about 16% of domestic retail spending is done online . The rest is still done in-store .  Rocket Lab USA has made 64 successful launches of its reusable Electron rocket, deploying 225 fairly small satellites . Its Neutron rocket is a medium-lift launch vehicle capable of putting up to 1,500 kilograms worth of payload en route to Mars or Venus .  Rocket Lab USAisn't profitable yet, and probably won't be at any point in the immediate future . Be patient, though. Be patient . Goldman Sachsepects the global satellite market to grow sevenfold between now and 2035 .  The company's 2024 top line of $13.7 billion was up 27% from 2023's lull, bouncing back from the swoon following its post-pandemic sales surge . Analysts are calling for similar growth at least through 2027 .  Shopify is arguably the riskiest of the three stocks in question here just because its big run-up from March's low has pushed it beyond analysts' consensus target of just over $300 . It wouldn't be crazy to wait for at least a small pullback .  John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors .

" Trump’s new taxes on imported goods haven’t reignited inflation yet, but many economists think they’re about to . Trump has raised the average tariff on some $3 trillion of imported goods from 2.5% to about 18% . The battle is fully underway over who should get the blame when higher prices hit consumers .  Some companies hope to avoid Trump's ire by using elliptical language to explain price hikes . Subaru recently said it’s raising the price of several models because of “current market conditions,” with no mention of tariffs . But there's thorough evidence that consumers will end up bearing the cost of Trump's tariffs .  57% of Americans blame US companies for tariff-related inflation, up from 34% in January . In the same poll, 80% of respondents said they blame Trump . But that may not cheer many companies raising prices, since consumers can perceive more than one villain .  A2024 study by the Boston Consulting Group found 30% of shoppers would buy from a different source if they could save money . Price, not quality, was the top factor driving consumers to switch purveyors . 80% of respondents say brands that offer consistent pricing are more trustworthy .  Trump tariffs are unexpected and abrupt by nature, since businesses can’t anticipate them and there’s no public playbook . Publicly owned companies have some cover because they’re obligated to be transparent with shareholders about factors affecting costs, pricing, revenue, and profitability . Smaller companies, wholesalers, and generic suppliers can be frank with their customers about Trumpflation because they won't see them on the news bashing his import taxes .  Consumers are bracing for another spurt of inflation in the next 12 months, caused by tariffs . The message businesses are trying to send is already getting through. It will be clearer when shoppers begin to see the tariff-related price hikes with their own eyes .",positive,"tariffs, tariff, inflation, consumers, goods"

" Amazon allegedlyrefused to grant leave to, and then fired, a warehouse worker with ectopic pregnancy . The worker requested an unpaid, five-week leave of absence to undergo surgery and recover from having the embryo and her right fallopian tube removed . Amazon allegedly refused to grant the worker’s request for leave and fired her because she wasn’t there .  The worker sued Amazon, claiming violations of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act . The PWFA is an accommodation statute, according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .  The order does not affect terminations of pregnancy or abortions stemming from the underlying treatment of a medical condition related to pregnancy . In an October 2024settlement, the EEOC confirmed the PWFA covers stillbirth . Employers may want to keep in mind that pregnancy-related issues often intersect with other statutes, such as the ADA and FMLA .  She also alleged that Amazon violated the FMLA, which entitles an eligible employee to 12 weeks’ unpaid leave in a calendar year for a “serious medical condition” This includes “any period of incapacity related to pregnancy or for prenatal care,” according to DOL .",negative,"terminations, fired, employment, employers, employee"

" The world of option trading is a fast-paced and exciting one . It can also be extremely lucrative provided that traders understand the risks involved . Many options traders fail because they attempt to predict the future, and as most options expire worthless, it’s not difficult to see why they have a low rate of success .  Discount brokers have been competing forcefully with one another, and all this competition has driven down rates . Individuals can now trade stocks for free in most cases, and options contracts cost just pennies on the dollar .  Traders should do their homework and decide which firm is best for their individual situation . Options are generally not as liquid as stocks, and therefore the market maker attempts to realize a profit from the bid/ask spread . This spread is typically much wider for options as opposed to stocks .  Amazon's July 18 160-strike call has a bid quote of 44.3 points and 44.9 points . As options cover 100 shares, the current asking price for interested buyers is $4,490 per contract . If you were to use a market order to purchase this call option, we’d expect to be filled at the ask price . Finding a market maker that is able to buy or sell at a more favorable price can result in significant cost savings .  Amazon appears to be resuming its longer-term uptrend, making it a good candidate for a call option purchase . Purchasing this option gives us the right to buy 100 shares of Amazon stock at $160 on or before the expiration date . A 15% increase in the stock price would yield a $3,042 profit .  A 15% move in AMZN stock would net a $2,868 profit – a nearly identical profit amount with only about one-fifth of the investment! Note that this option contains relatively little time value . The 1.75 points worth of time value equate to just 0.9% of the Amazon stock price .  Past performance is no guarantee of future results .

The precise scope of the refunds issued isn't clear but executives hinted it may be hundreds of millions of dollars . Amazon took a one-time charge of approximately $1.1 billion in the first quarter related in part to “some historical customer returns” that were unresolved .  Amazon said refunds are being sent to customers but declined to specify how many . Amazon faces a consumer lawsuit alleging it reversed refunds from customers who followed its returns policy by leaving merchandise at kiosks .  The policy was designed to fight fraud in which shoppers buy something and return an empty box or an imposter product seeking a refund .

" Tesla plans to resume shipping components from China to the U.S. for the production of Cybercab and Semi trucks . The Fly has you covered with “Charged,” a weekly recap of the top stories and expert calls in the sector .  Tesla previously suspended plans to ship components after U.S. PresidentDonald Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, potentially disrupting Tesla’s plan to start mass production of the much-anticipated models . The committee comprises chair Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson .  By the mid-2030s, Morgan Stanley forecasts Tesla’s installed base to approach 50M units and estimates that each $100/month of ARPU generated by this installed base is worth $80 to $100 per share . The energy storage business is Tesla's “fastest growing and highest margin hardware business at present,” adds that firm .  Cantor Fitzgerald remains “bullish” on Tesla ahead of several material near-term potential catalysts . The firm has an Overweight rating and $410 price target on Tesla . Cantor is encouraged by management’s reaffirmation of the launch of the Robotaxi in Texas in June .  Sales of new Tesla vehicles in China dropped 58% from the previous week and 69% year-over-year . Jefferies downgraded Rivian to Hold from Buy with an unchanged $16 price target . The firm believes Tesla is better positioned to mitigate the impact from tariffs .

Wolfe believes the company’s “domestic moat remains well intact” as the only domestic solar module manufacturer of scale .

The House Ways and Means Committee tax plan will eliminate the Section 25D Residential Clean Energy Credit for homeowners who take loans or pay cash for their residential solar and battery systems at the end of 2025 . This would shrink the overall demand for U.S. residential solar in 2026, further contributing to Enphase’s loss of market share, BMO argues .  Section 25D enables individual homeowners to claim the 30% tax credit for solar energy and storage installations . The residential solar market will likely evolve into over 90% third-party ownership starting next year .  Northland lowered its rating due to valuation .

" Udit Madan was a fast-rising Amazon vice president in his early 30s when the Covid pandemic upended Amazon’s operations . Madan had no specific experience in what he was being tasked with, especially amid a level of chaos he had not experienced before . But as Amazon colleagues have learned, Madan has proven to be an adeptly fast learners .  Madan is essentially Amazon’s chief supply chain officer and overseeing a global employee base north of 1 million warehouse and logistics employees . Madan ultimately oversees a fleet of tens of thousands of trucks, around 100 cargo airplanes, and 2,000-plus warehouses in more than two dozen countries .  Amazon's supply chain leader feels his division is by now built to sustain potential crises like that of the past two months . Madan was referencing new trucking and warehousing services that Amazon has launched in recent .  Amazon Warehouse and Distribution allows Amazon vendors and sellers to store large amounts of inventory in dedicated Amazon warehouses for a fee . AWD has come under fire from some sellers who felt pressured into using it simply to avoid new Amazon fees they'd otherwise have to pay .  Madan once considered becoming a doctor, and later flirted with an investment banking career . He joined Amazon as a software engineer in 2008 after graduating with degrees in computer science and economics . By 22, he had been promoted to manager and would soon go on to run large technology organizations for Amazon's new ‘last mile’ delivery businesses .  Madan stood out among peers for his ability to go both deep into the details, while also widening his viewpoint to understand more holistic strategies and business impacts . By 2017, he would be tapped for a coveted role known as a technical advisor or “shadow”—basically a chief of staff— for Amazon’s then head of worldwide supply chain operations .  Madan would not single out that one-year “shadow” role as more crucial than others in his development as a leader at Amazon . Madan has earned even more responsibility over the past six years . In 2019, he was elevated to a vice president .  Earlier this year, Madan was promoted again, to senior vice president . Madan said he told his team it is an acknowledgement of their work to serve customers and better the business .  Madan blindsided his direct reports with a litany of failings he believed they were responsible for . Madan could have ingratiated himself with his new direct reports by at least acknowledging that success . That’s not necessarily uncommon at Amazon .

" Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, such as the US dollar, but would not be protected by deposit insurance . The bill still faces hurdles from some Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who argued against the bill Monday night .  The bill would bar stablecoin accounts from offering interest to depositors . The Trump family is already in the stablecoin business . Some Democratic opposition to the bill faded as some argued that the Trump ties to crypto should not stand in the way of establishing rules around stablecoins .  The Senate will now debate the stablecoin bill while giving senators the option to offer amendments . The bill would need 60 votes to gain cloture to proceed to a final vote on the bill . It also includes a broad savings clause guaranteeing the application of existing federal consumer protection laws .  The bill also closes a loophole that could have allowed non-permitted offshore stablecoin issuers to offer their products on US-regulated exchanges . It empowers the Treasury secretary to delist non-compliant foreign issuers . Big Tech companies like Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) won't be allowed to issue stablecoins .  Some Democrats criticized that the bill still provides foreign-issued stablecoins, like Tether, multiple avenues to access US markets while evading the bill’s basic regulatory requirements .

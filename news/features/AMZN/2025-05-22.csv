" Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has held an investment in Amazon since 2019 . Amazon fits right in with Berkshire's portfolio of competitively positioned businesses . Domino's continues to go after market share gains in the massive pizza industry .  Amazon's largest revenue source is its online retail store, which generates 37% of the company's revenue . Its non-retail services made up 60% of its revenue last quarter . Amazon's ecosystem of services should protect its competitive moat as other retailers try to catch up .  Amazon is a small position for Berkshire, but the value of its Amazon shares was worth $1.9 billion at the end of Q1 . Amazon is trading at a reasonable multiple of just 19 times its trailing 12-month operating cash flow . Berkshire bought shares in third-quarter 2024 and has bought more shares of Domino's Pizza in each of the last two quarters .  Domino's experienced a small dip in sales in 2022, when inflation spiked to a 40-year high . This shows that the business could be vulnerable to a recession, which is something to keep in mind with the uncertainty over tariffs . The company's competitive advantage stems from a massive store base of over 21,000 worldwide . It is gradually opening more stores while earning a healthy profit margin of 13%.  Buffett wouldn't be buying the stock if Buffett and his deputies didn't see a lot of growth ahead . Despite leading the market, Domino's captures less than 25% of pizzas sold in the U.S. The stock is not cheap, trading at 28 times earnings .

" Amazon, with its dominant Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) cloud platform, continues to leverage its first-mover advantage and massive scale . Oracle positions itself as a specialized provider of database and enterprise applications with growing cloud ambitions through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure . Both tech giants have made significant investments in AI infrastructure and services .  Amazon's aggressive expansion of AI capabilities positions the company at the forefront of the AI revolution . Amazon's retail business also shows remarkable resilience with record delivery speeds and strong consumer engagement . Amazon has successfully regionalized its fulfillment network, resulting in faster deliveries and lower costs .  Amazon beat Wall Street expectations with EPS of $1.59, exceeding forecasts by 23 cents . First-quarter operating income grew 20% year over year to $18.4 billion . The company's diversified revenue streams, spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and subscription services, provide multiple growth vectors .  Oracle's recent performance has failed to impress investors . Revenues reached $14.13 billion, growing just 6.40% year over year but missing projections by $259.18 million . Despite adding its 101st cloud region, Oracle lacks the global reach and availability zones that Amazon offers .  Oracle's heavy reliance on its database business makes it vulnerable to cloud-native alternatives and multi-cloud strategies that bypass Oracle's traditionally high-margin offerings . Despite management's claims about cost advantages for AI workloads, Oracle lacks the semiconductor investments and specialized infrastructure that Amazon has built .  Amazon's annual CapEx pales in comparison to Amazon's infrastructure investments, raising questions about Oracle's ability to compete at scale in the capital-intensive cloud and AI markets . Amazon's forward P/E of approximately 30.66x is justified by its diversified revenue streams, market leadership in multiple high-growth sectors, and consistent ability to exceed earnings expectations . Oracle's relative valuation discount reflects legitimate concerns about its competitive position .  Amazon's enterprise value to free cash flow ratio provides a more compelling investment case . Amazon's diversification and scale provide a significantly more attractive risk-adjusted return profile than Oracle's narrower focus and smaller operational footprint . Amazon emerges as the decidedly stronger investment opportunity in the cloud and AI race .  Amazon's demonstrated ability to continuously reinvent itself and its leadership position in multiple high-growth markets give it unmatched potential for sustained outperformance .

" United Parcel Service isn’t growing its package delivery volumes these days . The company is pulling back on business with its largest customer in order to boost margins . But these moves could benefit the company and its investors down the road . The high yield has come much to the dislike of long-term investors .  UPS reported its third-quarter 2024 results in October . It ended an 18-month drought by returning to revenue and profit growth . But the recent quarter proved that the struggles are far from over . UPS' stock price tends to follow its operating margins .  UPS announced plans for a 50% reduction in shipment volumes with Amazon by June 2026 . In March 2024, UPS hosted an investor presentation centered around its ""Better and Bolder"" strategy . The shift toward a more streamlined, higher-margin business comes with the risk of leaving revenue on the table .  The decision to reduce Amazon deliveries will likely lead to lower revenue but could be a net positive for the company in the long term . UPS said that January declines in average delivery volume were less than expected, thanks to volume growth from certain business-to-business, SMB, and healthcare customers .  Dividuation is putting a lot of pressure on the company's balance sheet . Management has expressed confidence that it can support the payout . But long-term investors may prefer that UPS cut its dividend so it can focus on executing its turnaround .  The company is holding true to its long-term growth strategy by building out its network to cater to high-margin volumes . UPS could have easily doubled back on this plan just to boost its near-term results . The glass-half-full outlook is that the company will endure this challenging period, chart a path toward earnings growth .  UPS has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 14.8 and a forward P/E of 14.4 . UPS has the makings of a worthwhile dividend stock to double up on in May, not for its ultra-high yield but for where the business could be headed over the next three to five years .

Amazon stock is down 6% this year as investors worry about the impact of tariffs on its e-commerce business . Warren Buffett's company has built an incredible track record through its portfolio of high-quality investments . Amazon shares have gained 187% since Berkshire Hathaway first purchased the stock in 2019 .  Amazon CEO Andy Jassy discussed how the company is viewing the tariff situation . He explained that many U.S. retailers buy from resellers who buy goods from China, so customers buying on Amazon directly from Chinese sellers will still get a lower price . The company offers a huge assortment of products, which is beneficial because customers can easily switch to other products without leaving Amazon .  Amazon is well-positioned to withstand the impact of tariffs, and it has a huge growth runway . Amazon is poised to benefit from this shift in a massive way . Advertising, which is Amazon's fastest-growing segment, is largely insulated from tariffs .  Coca-Cola accounts for 10% of Berkshire Hathaway's total public stock holdings . Founded in 1892 and taken public in 1919, the company has delivered reliable earnings growth through shifting market conditions . Trading at roughly 24 times this year's expected earnings, Coke may not look particularly cheap compared to its sales momentum and earnings growth .  In February, Coke raised its dividend roughly 5% -- and the move marked the 63rd straight year that the company has increased its dividend payout per share . Only eight stocks in the entire market have a longer history of annual payout growth . Coke stock also offers a solid dividend yield of 2.8%, and investors who buy the stock at today's prices will enjoy higher yields over time .

" Credit cards are powerful tools that can help you save money, manage debt and earn rewards . We'll show you how to use these cards to your advantage, ensuring you get the most value . Balance transfer credit cards allow you to transfer existing credit card debt onto a new card with a 0% interest rate .  The best deals are often reserved for those with a strong credit rating . Pay the minimum monthly repayment and clear the debt within the interest-free period . Don't use the card for new purchases .  A 0% purchase card allows you to make new purchases without paying interest for a set number of months . This can save you thousands compared with using a standard credit card . Tesco has a respectable 'Goldilocks' deal in return for 18 months at 0%.  If you take out a 0% purchase card with a 10-month interest-free period and spend £2,000 on new appliances, you’ll clear the debt before interest kicks in . However, if you still have a balance after the 10 month period, you will start accruing interest at the standard rate, which can be as high as 27% annually . M&S and Barclaycard have the longest 0% purchases deals currently, at 24 months .  A cashback credit card rewards you with a percentage of your spending, effectively giving you back some of what you spend . If your card offers 1% cashback and you spend £100 on groceries, you'll earn £1 back . This cashback is typically credited to your account or added to your statement .  Points are usually earned based on the amount you spend and the class of your ticket . You can use points to cover the cost of flights or upgrades, though taxes and fees may still apply . American Express Premium Plus Card offers 30,000 Avios when you spend £6,000 in three months . Barclaycard Avios Plus Card gives 25,000 points for spending .  Most credit and debit cards charge around 3% on foreign transactions, meaning a £100 purchase abroad could cost you £103 . Specialist travel cards waive those fees, letting you spend abroad at the same rates your bank gets .

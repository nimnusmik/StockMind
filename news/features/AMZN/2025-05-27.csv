" Walmart is still growing in a challenging environment . Target is struggling to keep up as it faces tougher headwinds . The pricier stock with the lower dividend is still the better buy . Walmart is a larger and more globally diversified retailer than Target .  Walmart owns a growing digital advertising business, Walmart Connect, which peddles ads across its digital channels and inside its physical stores . Its largest market is the U.S., but it generates a lot of revenue from Mexico, Canada, China, and other countries . The company also operates an integrated advertising business called Roundel .  From fiscal 2022 to 2025, Walmart's revenue had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6%, as its earnings per share (EPS) had a CAGR of 14%. Walmart's comparable-store sales (comps) for its namesake banner in the U.S. increased 6.4% in fiscal 2022 . Sam's Club -- which competes againstCostco Wholesale -- also continued growing .  For fiscal 2026, Walmart expects its net sales to grow anywhere from 3% to 4% . It will inevitably face pressure from the Trump administration's unpredictable tariffs . Walmart could mitigate those challenges by shifting supply chains, leveraging its scale to negotiate better prices with its suppliers .  Both Target and Walmart were recently hit by boycotts for rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusivity initiatives . Target's heavier dependence on the U.S. market might make it a bigger target in those boycotts . Walmart's stock doesn't look like a bargain at 37 times forward earnings .  Target's stock looks significantly cheaper at 11 times forward earnings, and it pays a much higher yield of 4.7% . I think Walmart will continue to outperform Target because it's bigger, it's growing faster and it's better diversified . Target's downside might be limited at these levels, but it certainly won't command a higher valuation until it gets its act together .

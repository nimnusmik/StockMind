" The Trade Desk first quarter 2025 earnings conference call will be conducted by Chris Toth and Jeff Green . On the call today are Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer Laura Schenkein . A copy of our earnings press release is available on our website . Please note, this conference is being recorded .  Today's discussion and our responses during the Q&A may include forward-looking statements . These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and reflect our views and assumptions as of the date such statements are made . If any of our beliefs or assumptions prove incorrect, actual financial results could differ .  Jeff Green is the co-founder and CEO of the company . Jeff Green: ""Despite increasing economic uncertainty, we showed incredible resilience, growing revenue 25% year over year, far surpassing our own expectations""  Today, I want to focus on just three topics . First, the macro environment; second, the open Internet and some of the significant changes and market shifts that have happened recently . And third, all of the upgrades we've made at TTD, including the latest updates to Kokai .  Programmatic advertising is extremely agile because our technology buys one impression at a time and evaluates every single impression, we can adjust quickly . We aim to be a source of vision and stability for our clients .  Headwinds have historically accelerated the move to programmatic because of its data, its control, its agility and of course, its performance . We did the same thing during the pandemic. While consumers stayed home to stay safe, they also accelerated their move to streaming .  The Trade Desk is pointed at the entire open Internet, and nearly all of global advertising will be transacted programmatically at end state . We are convinced that based on the current landscape and current competitive set, we are the best positioned to win the lion's share of market share .  Google has been declared an illegal monopoly in two separate instances in 2025 by the US courts . In the recent lawsuit against Meta, the complaint argues Meta used a flawed blended price auction process to price and implement advertisements .  US federal judge ruled that Spotify can have a payment relationship directly with the consumer that is not mediated via Apple . Google announced that it is not going to eradicate cookies from its market-leading Chrome browser .  Google's view of the world and vision for the future is getting closer and was validated once again . 2025 may have some macro headwinds, but the open Internet has never been in a better place than it is today .  Google is already beginning to turn down and turn off some of the draconian and illegal practices of the past . Google essentially acts as the defendant, the plaintiff, the judge, the jury, the court reporter and the bailer in many ad transactions .  Google should stop trying to monetize the open Internet and instead focus more on destinations . CTV and streamers have invested more into advertising . We're seeing more supply than demand in all forms of advertising, but that is especially especially especially in advertising .  CTV companies are once again leading the supply dynamics of the open Internet . They are plugging directly into our demand and describing their supply in greater detail than ever . Nearly every scaled player has adopted UID2 and those that have not are under monetizing their inventory .  OpenPath is gaining wider adoption across the industry . It provides publishers with a much clearer view of what advertisers are willing to pay . The open Internet monetizes movies, television, journalism, music and sports .  The New York Post saw its digital advertising fill rate increase more than 8x with Openpath . VIZIO sats programmatic revenue increased 39% with OpenPath . The Trade Desk doesn't expect OpenPath to be the only supply chain for us .  OpenPath is keeping exchanges and SSPs in check so that we don't have to wait on government to untangle corrupt practices like those recently exposed at Google . Another massive upgrade to improve the supply chain was the acquisition of Sincera .  The core of Kokai has been delivered and adoption is now ahead of schedule . Two-third of our clients are now using it and the bulk of the spend in our platform is now running through Kokai . We expect all clients to be using it by the end of the year .  Kokai combines client needs with strong point of view on where value is shifting and how to deliver the most efficient return on ad spend . We will introduce the final major components of Kokai, including a revolutionary new approach for understanding the performance of deals .  The injection of our industry-leading CoA AI tools across every aspect of our platform has been a game changer, and we are just getting started . Walled Garden Measurement may tell an advertiser, they've accounted for 1 million toothbrush sales this quarter, but they only actually sold 0.5 million .  Kokai is a way to unlock the full value and performance potential of the open Internet . Deutsche Telekom was able to use advanced AI tools in our Kokai platform to find new customers and define the right ad impressions across display and CTV .  Kokai is delivering on lower funnel KPIs, including 24% lower cost per conversion . Deutsche Telekom is now planning to use Kokai across more campaigns . Kokai has seen a 42% reduction in cost per unique reach .  Kokai used roughly 30% more data elements per impression. in our data marketplace to increase the discoverability of third-party data campaigns on Kokai . We simplified our go-to-market teams and their org structures. We've hired a new COO, Vivid Kandra. He joined the company as our new Chief Operating Officer.  The largest independent and objective DSP will command the lion's share of market share at end state . Today, we control less than 2% of the global advertising TAM, leaving us with an extraordinary runway for growth in front of us .  Trade Desk CEO: ""We have been winning in an unfair market -- we are even more confident we can win in a fair market"" ""This process has done a great deal to shine a light on the power of the open Internet,"" he says .  As I said, Kokai adoption now represents the majority of our spend, almost two-third, a significant acceleration from where we ended 2024 . We will continue to iterate and ship product every week. It's why we will never stop innovating.  The upgrades we made at the end of 2024 are beginning to deliver results, putting us in a better position to capture expanding market opportunities . Kokai adoption accelerated exiting December and our product and engineering teams are shipping -- growth remains strong .  Q1 revenue was $616 million, a 25% increase year over year . We generated $208 million of adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, representing a 34% margin . Our Sincera acquisition closed in Q1, and there is no revenue as a result of this acquisition .  International growth again outpaced North America for the ninth quarter in a row . Q1 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $433 million, up 23% from a year ago .  In Q1, we repurchased $386 million of our Class A common stock via our share repurchase program . DSO exiting the quarter were 85 days, down one day from a year ago . Income tax expense was $25 million for the first quarter, driven by our profitability and stock-based rents .  In Q2, we expect revenue to be at least $682 million, reflecting 17% year over year growth . We are encouraged by the strength of our underlying business, driven by continued progress on Kokai is our enhancements to our engineering and go-to-market teams and a growing pipeline of joint business plans .  We are confident in our ability to outpace the market and capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead . Our focus is on maintaining a balanced and efficient expense base, allowing us to stay agile and well positioned to capture share .  Q1 was a very strong quarter for us, and we showed our resilience. I think the team felt like they had something to prove, and I think we did it. I'm really proud of how well the team has executed. The upgrades that we made to our business did help contribute to our outperformance. They were not easy, but they definitely were worth it.  Two-third of our clients are now using Kokai, which is ahead of schedule . Kokai's delivering on lower funnel KPIs, including 24% lower cost per conversion and 20% lower price per acquisition .  The new reporting structures are working and they're leading to more engagement with brands and agencies . We still have work to do. We have not realized all the fruits of those upgrades . There's still more to come on that but trend line is awesome .  Operator Vasily Karasyov. Jeff, thank you very much for your comments regarding the guilty verdict and the Google trial . Jeff is very excited about our future and the opportunity to open Internet. even more excited about the opportunities ahead .  2025 has been a very rough year for Google, but even for walled gardens as a whole . Apple's decision to focus more on AI search engines rather than Google as a result of the remedy of that first trial is as significant as anything .  We think that this is a major victory for the open Internet. We think, again and again, we're seeing walled gardens and draconian tactics around auctions being put in check so that the market is more fair. And I don't believe there's any player that better represents the interest of the Open Internet and the Trade Desk . But thanks for the question.  Many large brands speaking to increased uncertainty in their reports . How do you think about that in your Q2 guidance? And how are you managing the business into the back half of the year? Jeffrey Green: I'm just really proud of our team's performance .  We think that for the rest of the year, our focus has to be on recognizing that large brands are facing comparatively tough times, and we need to be there to help them navigate that and be a source of strategic consulting for them . But of course, we have our eye on the horizon . We believe that we will grab land in the next year or accelerate growth and potentially both .  There's still a lot of exciting things coming out of Kokai. It seems that we continue to upgrade -- so there are a few major pieces left that we expect to ship in the very near future. So we're extremely excited about all the upgrades that are coming and all the things that we're building .  Jeff, Jeff, on Amazon, it's gotten a lot of attention recently, both in our investor meetings, but also in the press specifically around its DSP and the push into prime video ads . We believe at end state, the objective focused DSP will have the lion's share of market share, and we just got to keep executing .  The TAM is massive and there will be lots of players that I think have room to do well in this space . I think there's opportunity for a healthy competition, but I believe the objective DSP that aligns its interest with buyers will win the lion's share of market share .  Amazon is building this product to sell more prime video ads, not to be objective . Amazon is competing with Fortune 500 companies across food, retail, cloud, delivery and so many others . There's already a big concern about the amount of data that exists inside of AWS .  Prime Video will open up its inventory to additional demand because it's a little bit different than YouTube where there's so much supply and it's lower quality . Prime Video is obviously more professional content that might welcome additional demand .  Amazon's DSP at Amazon is focused on the open Internet, CEO says . He says content companies are leaning into partnerships with them in part because they know who we are and what we stand for, unlike those that are being more duplicitis .  Jeff Green: ""We think we'll earn it. We just have to keep executing"" Operator Jessica Reif Ehrlich: ""It's going to mostly be up to us and continuing to execute""  As a result of uncertainty, it's harder to want to commit to put dollars to work at a certain rate for the course of an entire year . So instead, what happens at the upfront is people go in with a commitment to try or to put money in a more agile setting, and there is nothing more than programmatic. So we anticipate that this upfront will be a little bit weaker for linear .  OpenPath is releasing a product called Deal desk that will lay groundwork for us to get more forward market like deals and create a lot more sophistication and performance out of upfronts or forward market than what currently exists in the upfronts .  The Arena group increased their fill rate by 4x and their revenue by 79% on Open Path . The New York Post increased its fill rates by 8x and its revenue by 97% . Spotify, FOX, FOX are integrating right now, and we have hundreds of others like Reuters, Washington Post, Dotdash Meredith .  We just need visibility from it so that we can make certain that we're steering the supply chain in the right way. We think we're in a better position to capitalize on a more efficient supply chain than we ever had in the past .  Jeff, the first question, I appreciate the commentary on the Amazon competition. I did want to ask you about DV360 because it does seem like they continue to invest in that product with more retail media functionality and things like that . I guess do you see like a byproduct of the DOJ suit being Google kind of stepping on the gas on the DSP side maybe? Or just would love to get your thoughts there. Laura, the sequential decline was a lot better than what we typically see in Q1.  The cost of goods sold in YouTube is close to zero. -- it's an amazing asset for them. But it's not the open Internet. And it certainly -- they're not in a position to objectively buy the rest of the open .  Q4 to Q1 sequential strength was driven by political simply because we exited presidential cycle in the US, entered 2025 when we're not in an off-cycle and don't have much contribution . So it's more just strength in the changes we're making to the business, Mark. there's a to end up and then we'll monetize the open Internet, and they will monetize YouTube. I think that's almost what it is already, to your point, Laura.",neutral,"earnings, profitability, strategic, business, outperformance"

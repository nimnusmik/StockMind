" A recent caller to “The Ramsey Show” shared how ongoing custody disputes with two former partners are draining both his bank account and mental health .

Tanner had a 50/50 custody agreement for his son, but he hasn't seen him in over a year . His ex-wife and the ex-girlfriend have since become friends and have made legal proceedings more difficult . Tanner said he has no history of substance abuse or violence .  Ramsey told Tanner Tanner the system had failed him, and his passive legal approach wasn't working . He urged Tanner to file multiple motions, pressure the courts, and create enough legal action to force progress . “Sometimes the best defense is a good offense,” Ramsey said .

" Amazon is a strong foundation for a diversified portfolio . The company’s e-commerce and cloud businesses generate massive revenue and profits .

Amazon is diversified, but it really can't compete with Berkshire or your favorite index fund on that front . Amazon has been a helpful part of my own portfolio since 2017 .

" Nvidia and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos are both investors in AI data center company Nebius Group . Nebius is involved with Nvidia's Blackwell GPU rollout across Europe and the U.S. Rising infrastructure spend from cloud hyperscalers bodes well for the future growth prospects of Nebius .  Nebius is involved with several different businesses . During the fourth quarter, the company generated $37.9 million in revenue -- up 466% year over year . The AI infrastructure represented over half of this revenue -- growing by more than 600% annually .  Nebius is heavily involved in the rollout of Nvidia's latest GPU architecture, dubbed Blackwell, across Europe and the U.S. Recent trends suggest that shares are currently experiencing some momentum . From a macro perspective, rising AI infrastructure is a positive tailwind for Nebius .  Nebius has gotten caught up in broader buying, making it a dicey opportunity . The most important thing to be on the lookout for is whether or not Nebius reaches or exceeds its ARR goal of $220 million . While I am optimistic that Nebius will produce strong results in Q1, I tend to shy away from investing in momentum stocks .

" Walmart said on May 15 that the Trump tariffs will force it to raise prices on many items, starting at the end of the month . Virtually all retailers will follow Walmart's lead, whether they announce it or not . Trump has raised the average import tax on some $3 trillion worth of products from 2.5% to around 18% .  The inflation rate in April was just 2.3%, which is basically back to normal after a surge of inflation that got as high as 9% in 2022 . Most of the stuff retailers are selling now comes from inventories built up before the tariffs went into effect .  Trump has tried to pressure American importers into eating the cost of the tariffs and even keeping mum about their effects on business . It's normal practice for businesses to pass on as much of the higher cost of tariffs as they can to their own customers . Trump can't cow all of corporate America, especially given that CEOs of public companies are legally obligated to share cost and pricing information with their shareholders and investors .  Other companies have announced price hikes related to tariffs, including Ford, Mattel, Birkenstock, and Stanley Black & Decker . Consumer surveys show that consumers expect sharply higher inflation in the coming months .  Yale Budget Lab forecasts price hikes of 15% for leather goods such as handbags and belts, 14% for clothing and electronics, 11% for textiles, and 9% for automobiles and basic pharmaceuticals . Biggest price hikes will arrive on products that largely come from China, because that's where Trump has imposed the highest tariff .  Most economists think the Trump tariffs will only push inflation to around 4% . Gasoline prices, meanwhile, are at a manageable $3.20 per gallon or so, down about 12% from a year ago . Trump is testing the tolerance of businesses and consumers .",positive,"tariffs, tariff, inflation, retailers, walmart"

" UPS stock has fallen sharply in recent years because of several factors . However, the company is focusing on boosting profitability . UPS' resilience, dividend, and valuation make it a great stock to buy on the pullback .  UPS stock went up nearly 150% between early March 2020 and early January 2022 . Amazon ranks as the company's largest customer, accounting for 11.8% of its total revenue in 2024 .  UPS' network restructuring related to Amazon glidedown will cut roughly $3.5 billion in costs this year . The average daily volume associated with Amazon decreased by 16% in Q1 and ran ahead of the company's plan . UPS CEO Carol Tomé remains convinced that reducing the Amazon business makes sense .  Healthcare presents an especially great opportunity because it tends to be relatively recession-proof and is growing briskly . UPS operates one of the biggest delivery networks on the planet . The prohibitive cost of building such a network gives the company a solid business moat .  UPS' shares trade at 14.6 times forward earnings, a historically low level for the company . The focus on boosting profitability could allow UPS to fund dividends at least at current levels . Some might view UPS as a ""falling knife"" to avoid, but buying this beaten-down stock now will pay off handsomely .

" Apple may get surpassed by Amazon in market cap by the end of this year . Amazon has reason to grow its profits while Apple's may fall . The two stocks' valuations indicate that Amazon has the potential to surpass Apple . Here's why I predict Amazon stock will finish 2025 ahead of Apple in 2025 .  Amazon has grown its revenue by 102% in the last five years, compared to 46% for Apple . Amazon is growing faster than Apple at a larger revenue base, too, generating $650 billion in revenue over the last 12 months vs. $400 billion at Apple . The company plays in two huge addressable markets: e-commerce and cloud computing .  Amazon's supply chain is already optimized to the gills, posting 32% operating margins over the last 12 months . Apple's profit margins may move in the other direction if it gets hurt by tariff costs on imports to the U.S. from China . Another factor that could hurt Apple's profitability is looming lawsuits coming for its default search engine payment and App Store fees .  Apple's operating income of $127 billion greatly surpasses Amazon's $72 billion over the past 12 months . Amazon's operating margin will keep expanding along with its durable revenue growth . Apple's business is at risk of losing two huge cash cows that will dampen its overall profitability .  Amazon will finish the year ahead in market capitalization . Amazon will be valued more than Apple, and will finish ahead of Apple . Nvidia, Apple, Netflix and Netflix are all about to pop . Now is the best time to buy before it’s too late .

" The market wasn't particularly excited about Walmart’s WMT results last Thursday, but we think the retail leader did an excellent job in an otherwise challenging environment . The positives of the Walmart report were better-than-expected comps, the company’�s domestic ecommerce business turning profitable for the first time, and its ability to provide guidance despite the all-around operating uncertainty .  Target shares have been big-time laggards lately, with the stock losing more than a quarter of its value this year . The chart below shows the one-year performance of Target shares (down -38.2%) relative to Walmart (up +51.6%) Target is expected to report $1.68 in EPS on $24.42 billion in sales, representing year-over-year changes .  Target's discretionary-heavy merchandise tend to be more trade-exposed relative to food . Walmart claims that two-thirds of its merchandise is domestically sourced, limiting its exposure to the unsettled tariff situation . The operating environment for Home Depot and Lowe's remains difficult .  The elevated levels of mortgage rates have proved a big disappointment for the broader housing space, including the home-improvement retailers . However, weakness around discretionary spending is also at play here, as residential remodeling and the associated big-ticket purchases like appliances, cabinets, flooring, etc., are basically discretionary spending categories .  The China tariff pause is a net positive, but it points to challenges in the second half of the year, when activity levels were expected to start improving . Most activity at Home Depot and Lowe’s has been geared to repair and replace, with big-ticket purchases that typically accompany residential remodel projects on hold .  Home Depot’s comps had turned positive for the first time after eight quarters of declines in the preceding period . The expectation is for same-store sales of +0.28% for this quarter . Lowe's comps are expected to be down -1.99% again this quarter. The Zacks Retail sector includes Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, online vendors like Amazon .  Total Q1 earnings for these 21 retailers that have reported are up +16.7% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues, with 57.1% beating EPS estimates and only 47.6% beating revenue estimates . The 21 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have already reported Q1 results belong mostly to ecommerce and restaurant industries .  Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor . As we noted in the context of discussing Walmart’s upcoming results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player, thanks to its growing digital business .  Over 100 companies on deck to report results this week, including 15 S&P 500 members . Ralph Lauren, TJX Companies, Toll Brothers, and China’s Baidu are among the notable companies reporting this week .  The expectation is that earnings will be up +12.4% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues . The Q1 revenue beats percentage of 62.1% compares to the 5-year average for this group of index members of 70.7% .  Estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been coming down, as you can see in the chart below . The magnitude of cuts to 2025 Q2 estimates since the start of the period is bigger and more widespread relative to what we have become used to seeing in the post-COVID period . The chart below shows how Tech sector earnings estimates for the period appear to have bottomed two weeks back and have, in fact, actually started going back up .  Zacks is hesitant to claim that downward adjustments to estimates have run its course . If trend continues in the coming weeks, it will be hard to interpret this development as a clear sign that the earnings picture has clearly stabilized and started to strengthen .

This is not something we have been talking about for the last couple of months, is just day by day, you just don't know really what is going to happen""  A lot of what we've been discussing in regard to tariffs and trade talks, most of this is really centered around ultimately China . China is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, as they would say. This is where we really need to figure this deal out because when you talk about trade deficits, and there are positives and negatives .  This trade deficit has just continued to grow. It hit a peak of close to $420 billion in 2018. Today, it's closer to around $300 billion. Hopefully, this is a sign of good things to come. We don't know a lot. There are not a lot of specifics, but it does seem like progress is at least being made.  Jason Moser: The market is essentially flat. Ho-hum, who cares? This has just been a really bumpy ride, going back to, you remember how this all started? It's nice to see at least some progress being made. Go back to that UK trade deal .  China is really seen as the most important of all of these deals . This is not a permanent solution. This is just something that it's extending the timeline. It's indicating that, hey, conversations are being had, because if you think about it, this tit for tat just doesn't work .  Jason Moser: Good day for the market. Even better day for companies that are in the business of buying and selling . As you noted, this is a reset, but a reprieve as well. Not a full solution.  Amazondoing well, Nike doing well, Shopify doing well . I think it's nice to see those companies at least starting to recover a little bit from these lows . We may get some more commentary on the big picture here when we see Walmart and some of the Chinese companies later in the week .  Fox One will be launching before the upcoming football season, which I can't imagine is an accident . There's a history of legacy media companies getting streaming services wrong . Fox wants to make sure to offer something for everyone, says Moser .  Fox One streaming service is going to be Fox News, Fox Sports and Fox News . It's a very popular portfolio, and it garners a lot of viewers, and I think that really matters . NFL is just big business, and Fox benefits greatly from that .  Fox already owns Tubi, which is a free streaming service . Dylan Lewis: It's going to be something that I think helps expand their viewership and gives everybody a chance to participate .  A sleeper in the streaming space in a lot of ways, but at a critical mass. ad-supported streaming service. I think with what they saw for Super Bowl editions, they are probably over 100 million monthly active users at this point. It's not a profitable operation for them yet, but they've done over a billion dollars .  It's just interesting that, I don't know about you, it's not top of mind for me. I'm not the biggest Tubi user. I know we have the app on our TV, and I guess we use it every once in a while if we're searching for content. But again, you mentioned this massive base of user, closing in on 100 million monthly active users. That's only going to continue to grow. in 2025.  Dylan Lewis: Fox is not a name that we talk about all that often and to our detriment . But obviously, it's working out very well for the company . Shares up almost 60% over the last 12 months .  The ratings that Fox brings in, I think we all know. Fox does pretty well with all of its properties. I think they really benefited tremendously from this most recent election cycle.

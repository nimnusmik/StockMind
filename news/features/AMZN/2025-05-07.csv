" Motley Fool analysts Jason Moser and Asit Sharma join host Ricky Mulvey to discuss: If the U.S. economy is sliding into a recession . If investors should mind 20% of theS&P 500's market cap being tied to four companies . Two stocks worth watching:TwilioandReddit .  The Motley Fool is issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, available when you joinStock Advisor, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon . Right now is the best time to buy before it’s too late .  US GDP fell by 0.3% this quarter . Shipments to the port of Los Angeles will be down 35% from one year ago . Non-farm payrolls came in well ahead of expectations at 177,000 for April .  We haven't seen the effects yet of tariffs that have gone into effect this week . As the weeks wind on into this new quarter, I believe we're going to see some shelves that have fewer products . We'll see now hikes on prices of big ticket items, maybe even some smaller ticket items .  Nearly a quarter of Americans, 24%, are scrapping plans to make significant purchases, like a home or a car as of today . Another 32% say they're putting big-ticket purchases on hold . Ricky Mulvey: Jason Moser: ""I think those data points are all very clear""  When it comes to recessionary times, we associate recessions with bear markets, and that's very fair because typically we see market underperformance during recessions, obviously . A flip side to that is, it's like we make most of our money during bear markets . We just don't know it at the time, that Old Shelby Davis saw. It is very difficult to go through it as an investor .  Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in the latest earnings report, ""When there are uncertain environments, customers tend to choose the provider they trust most"" Ricky Mulvey: These are the times when you really want to be keeping an eye out there for a lot of those great businesses that perhaps can be going on sale, so to speak .  CEO Andy Jassy also pointed out that Amazon mostly sells goods at a lower price point, including some $100 billion of groceries annually . He's got a point there, Amazon is this big machine for substituting goods. They can get stronger. Amazon is a platform business on the e-commerce side .  Amazon Web Services just continues to be this juggernaut . Management really wasn't that worried about tariffs . Overall, this was a very decent quarter for Amazon . I see some near-term trouble ahead for Amazon that might last a quarter or two .  Most of that operating income is coming from Amazon Web Services . Operating income in total up by more than 20% from a year ago . Ricky Mulvey: Amazon has a pretty solid business that can get stronger in this environment .  Ricky Mulvey: Meta is telling investors a story with AI and glasses, and Apple is using $100 billion to buy back stock . We'll talk about that after the break .  The overall message from Zuck seemed to be, AI is going to sell Meta users more stuff and keep you on those platforms for longer . Jason Moser: Ricky, what happened to the word Metaverse?  Meta is basically there with its AI aspirations, but certainly a good corner of the market received it very well . Revenue of $412 million, that was actually down, but this thing is still chalking up massive losses . $4.2 billion in operating losses just for the quarter .  Facebook Inc. raised guidance on their CapEx spend for the full year to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion . That's up from 60-65 billion just a quarter ago . Clearly, they are spending a lot of money, but it feels like it's the right investment .  Microsoft Cloud's revenue was up 20% to 42.4 billion . Asit Sharma: Investors really liked that Microsoft's Cloud revenue is still going very strong with all the uncertainty that investors have to worry about across the investment landscape .  Total revenue for Microsoft is $70 billion. That's an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter . Net income also increased very nicely, about $26 billion. tied to AI initiatives. Microsoft is really showing that despite a lot of trepidation in the markets and in the business world, its customers still want to spend on AI .  Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, is the original Cloud builder. He built that Azure business, and he knows better than maybe a handful of people on the planet exactly how much to build and when to pull back on data center leases .  Apple announced plans to invest $500 billion in the U.S. and $100 billion share repurchase plan . Jason Moser: It was a relatively uneventful quarter . Revenue growth of 5% and earnings per share up 8%, but missed estimates just slightly . He says tariffs could contribute up to $900 million worth of costs for the business .  Apple has done a very good job over the last several years, trying to diversify their supply chain, and they're making big investments in India . Ricky Mulvey: I was actually really impressed with iPad revenue that was up 15% from a year ago . But I think as with most companies, right, the conversation revolves around tariffs and how companies are dealing with these .  Asit Sharma: Apple, Amazon, Microsoft make up about 20% of the whole market cap of the S&P 500 . Jason Moser: These are the times when the strong gets stronger, and so they're the ones that are going to be able to weather the storm . Ricky Mulvey: Up next, we're going on a trip, a look at the travel industry .  Universal Epic Universe is the first major new theme park to come to Orlando in more than 25 years . The park has five separate lands, SuperNintendoworld, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, the Ministry of Magic . Rick Munarriz: ""I've never seen a park that looks this good before it opens""  The Ministry of Magic Ride is down more often than it's up, but everything else is beautiful . The details are great. The ecosystem is there for all these restaurants, very different restaurants. There's a hotel literally in the back of the park where you can walk in .  Universal Studios has a lot of advanced animatronics on display at the park . Rick Munarriz: Universal Studios is not just about rides and roller coasters, but it's also about animatronic creatures .  Rick Munarriz: This is really a next level experience that I think once they get all the bugs worked out, it's going to be very popular, and popular for the tourism industry in general . Mary Long: It's one thing to go to a theme park like this and to experience it as a guest .  Epic Universe is not selling annual passes at all at Epic Universe . Instead, you have to pay 140, 150, $160 for a day at the park instead of spending 500, 600, $700 for an annual pass . They are going to be making a lot of money at this park .  Theme parks are almost a quarter to a third of Disney's business . Theme parks for Comcast is basically 6, 7% of the revenue mix in the last couple of quarters . Comcast is not a very exciting company. Trade's at a low multiple.  The timing of this park opening comes at what feels like a bit of a precarious time for the travel industry . Mary Long: For Comcast, they're putting more interest into it now . Unlike its cable business or even broadband connectivity, it has a good chance to keep growing rather than declining in the years to come .  US hotels to grow by only shy of half of a percent this year this year . Rick Munnariz: International travel is going to be iffy while there's course of international trade war going around .  Hilton's earnings for the first quarter came in at $300 million . That's up over 13% from the year before . Mary Long: It seems that there are some travel companies that are maybe bucking this trend . Long: People, too, consumer, the residential business folks like me and my family .  Rick Munnariz: ""I don't know if they cracked the code, but they are gaining market share"" Mary Long: ""If people aren't going to be traveling, it's not as if Hilton has this lock where they'll never let people check out, like Hotel California or anything like that""  Rick Munnariz: The moral of the story is that rising tides does not lift all ship cruise line stocks . Royal Caribbean, the stock is up 63% over the past year .  Royal Caribbean is a company that has historically grown faster than Norwegian Cruise Lines has produced better margins . Norwegian Cruise had to be fair of the decline . Part of it was that some of their large ships were in dry dock .  Rick Munnariz: ""I would say yes, but mostly no. one company and Norwegian Cruise Line. There is a difference. To me, I don't have to fly to the major ports. All three of the major cruise lines have ports""  Royal Caribbean said that their cancellation rate for this last quarter was no different than it was before . But when we get to later in the year, the economy does have to play along because even though a lot of the people that go on cruises, they may be older .

Ricky Mulvey: Pay attention to how they're being stored, to how you have access or custody over that asset, because it turns out it matters .

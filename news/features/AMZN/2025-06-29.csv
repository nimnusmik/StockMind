" Lawyers and wealth management experts outlined the prenup process for the superrich . Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his first wife got married without a pre-nup in 1993 .  Prenups begin with both people fully disclosing their financial assets and debts, experts say . They can also involve everyone from business partners and tax attorneys to luxury realtors and aviation experts .  Wealthy clients tend to have properties and business interests around the globe, making it harder to ensure compliance with divorce and death laws in various jurisdictions . Many entrepreneurs like Bezos are focused on insulating their businesses in the event of a divorce or death .  A last will and testament may take precedent over a prenup . Prenups for the ultrawealthy have repercussions beyond the couple . Surviving assets during a marriage are also key for wealthy clients .  Bezos shares four children with Scott, and Sánchez has three kids . Hekmat said all the prenups he draws up have a confidentiality provision .

" With Apple and Tesla struggling, perhaps it's time for a shake-up in the ""Magnificent Seven"" lineup . Palantir's revenue growth is accelerating, and its long-term opportunities appear to be huge . Broadcom reports strong growth in its networking portfolio and has an even bigger opportunity in custom AI chips .  Both Apple and Tesla stocks have had poor starts to 2025 . The reason for Apple's share price underperformance is that its revenue growth has slowed to a glacial pace . A big part of Apple's issues is that it has not innovated. It has had no new breakout products in the last several years .  Apple is losing smartphone market share to local rivals in China . It is possible that regulators and the courts may force Alphabet to end the deal that makes Google the default search engine on Apple devices . Apple has been generating solid growth in its high-margin services business .  Tesla's EV deliveries fell by 13% in the first quarter, while auto revenue dropped by 20% . In the second quarter, EV deliveries dropped an even worse 14% . Some of the blame can also be pinned directly on CEO Elon Musk's political actions .  Tesla bulls are still betting that its robotaxi business will be a game changer . Palantir and Broadcom have had strong starts to the year . Waymo has established the early lead in the driverless ride-sharing race .  Palantir's revenue from federal government sources grew by 45% year over year to $373 million . Its sales to U.S. commercial customers grew at an even faster rate, but from a smaller base . The company recently landed a significant contract with NATO, showing that international defense has the potential to become a third meaningful growth pillar .

The growth is being led by its AI networking portfolio, where it provides networking components such as Ethernet switches, optical receivers, DSPs and NICs .

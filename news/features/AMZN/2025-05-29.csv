" In this podcast, Motley Fool co-founder and Chief Rule Breaker David Gardner joins host Ricky Mulvey for a conversation about how he thinks about valuation . They discuss Palantir's current valuation, and what investors should prepare for . The value of paying up for ""top dogs"" and holding on to them for long periods of time .  Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, available when you joinStock Advisor . Apple:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008,you’d have $37,070!* Netflix: If you invested in the company in 2004, you'd have $639,271!  Motley Fool co-founder and chief Rule Breaker David Gardner joined us for a conversation on today's show . Gardner: I've been thinking a lot about and not buying, maybe to my detriment, a company called Palantir . At the time of this writing, it's got a blistering valuation, about 95 times enterprise value to revenue .  David Gardner: Rule Breaker is focused not on all the stocks or the whole market . I focus on the innovator in each industry. That is trait number one of rule Breaker stocks and there are six traits .  You will never buy Palantir if you're trying to find a cheap, says Ricky Mulvey . That's true industry by industry, Ricky, for the rule breakers. who's the first mover, not just any industry . That, for me, is the way to maximize your returns as an investor .  David Gardner: Why are all the best companies always trading at premium valuations? Why wasIntuitive Surgicalwhen I first picked it in 2005, trading at something like 75 times earnings . Yet, it's gone up more than 100 times in value since then in the 20 succeeding years . Virtually every great company from Tesla to Netflix, the list goes on .  The performance of a company and the quality of its stock over time is directly correlated to its brand . Who the CEO is, what's the culture of the company? Can it innovate its way out of a box? What about its brand? None of those four is included anywhere in the financial statements .  Ricky Mulvey: What about their brand, the promise you make to your customers every day? This is an incredibly important point. It's one I try to make big in my rule Breaker Investing book that comes out this fall .  Some of the biggest winners in the full universe, some of which you mentioned, Amazon, Netflix, Mercado Libre, I use Y charts, which sometimes can mess some things up, especially for historic multiples . These often traded above ten times enterprise value to revenue, sometimes even 45 times if you look at an early Amazon . But, that's a comparative value town to where Palantir is today, which is a more mature company .  David Gardner: I think it's natural to recognize when companies are at all time high, not just for their stock, but for their valuation multiples . Gardner: When I buy a stock at a dead minimum, I'm holding it for at least three years. Preferably three decades. What ends up mattering is not the valuation multiple that you paid for 17 or seven years ago, which I can't even remember now. What matters far more.  The companies that are winning for everybody, not equally in all the time, but the companies that just keep winning, are winning . What really matters is the impact of that company in the world . Nvidia was my best stock pick for Motley Full Stock Advisor, the company behind AI .  Ricky Mulvey: The direction of the stock market is not parabolic . It's lower left to upper right, not always at the same time and sometimes downward . That's what enables me to buy a Palantir which I did not ten years ago .  Ricky Mulvey: There are things that people should know about Palantir, and that's just part of being a shareholder in them . He says it can create a digital twin of the organization, and then you can go in and decide what needs stocking, where, and what a complex logistics operation .  David Gardner: I still think trees can't grow to the sky more than 90 times enterprise value to revenue . Gardner: Palantir is up about four or five times the value since I first bought. It could be about to drop 50%, as indeed, we saw Nvidia do within the last couple of years .  Ricky Mulvey: I'm watching Netflix lose two thirds of its value in the face of its self inflicted gunshot wound known as Quickstar more than ten years ago, it's not fun to watch companies lose half or more of their value within inside of one year .  David Gardner: I think the earlier stage a company is, the less its valuation matters. The later stage it's, the more it matters. I think there's a perception that in order to really be a smart, successful investor, you need to be able to value stocks, and people will ask you questions, insinuating questions .  When he first wrote, really, when he came on the scene a century ago, the markets were so inefficient . The knowledge gap between people who had a balance sheet and people who couldn't look at the balance sheet was substantial . Over the course of the last century, that's largely been erased, he says .  Ricky Mulvey: Most managers care about what the next earnings are going to be and the quarter after that . David Gardner: There's a huge amount of money just sitting there on the valuations you're seeing every day on the markets .  If you're looking six years ahead instead of six quarters ahead or two quarters ahead, you will actually be playing almost your own game . What you're seeing are valuations that look in a two quarter period as if they're too high .  Most people are not playing the game that you and I will win which is to buy and to hold the great companies of our time . Ricky Mulvey: When you only look for cheap stocks, then you miss out on a lot of the big tech players and market-dominating companies that have emerged in the stock market .  There are times where not looking at valuation can bite investors and there are times when looking at valuations . For those who bought Shopify at the peaks of 2021, they're still down on that at the height of a recent cycle of investing excitement .  David Gardner: I think everybody should start with 20 stocks. With $1,000, you can have a 20 stock portfolio. I don't believe anybody should determine what they think about the stock market and investing directly in stocks based on one stock .  Ricky says dollar-cost averaging into stocks directly is the approach everybody should be taking . Ricky: We should all just constantly be investing every two weeks if we're wage earners, and adding to the market and the best companies that we can find . Ricky says he's not sure Shopify is back to its all time highs yet .  A few months ago there were a lot of people, at least on my Facebook feed saying, I'm shorting Tesla . That was actually probably the worst time to either sell or short the company, but that's still one with a very complicated future .  David Gardner: I think there are people in the let's say left and moderate that say, everywhere I drive. I don't want to necessarily promote a political affiliation with that. That harm to the brand may be undoable. Especially as people are making big purchases with electric cars .  If Tesla's not there for you, don't do it. For me, it is. I'm not about Elon Musk's politics. I think that Elon is a phenomenal innovator across multiple industries. There are lots of people who work at Tesla .  This is a company that created a revolution. Everybody else is still trying to catch up to the electric cars while Tesla is going to start bringing out robots. Robots are a bigger industry than cars and they won't be the only player. But I'm invested, because I love what the company does. I do drive a Tesla and I do so unashamedly .  The stock a year ago, the day we're recording, this conversation is Monday, May 19th was at 175 . Today, it's just short of 350. Ricky Mulvey:I think we're possibly missing the forest for the trees if we're getting too. I'm talking about anybody who thinks this is a serious problem and long term damage .  As we move forward, rule breakers can become rule makers . David Gardner: Not every company that goes through that process, rule breaker to rule maker stops growing at that point .  Amazon is a great example of the rule breakers that continue to break the rules as they lead their industry and the world forward . Netflix, Amazon, Nvidia and Netflix are examples of those who started out with David positioning and are now within their contexts, the Goliath, and they are innovating at a pace intuitive surgical .  I'm always going to have my money on the innovators and I love to find them as early as I can, like we did with Shopify . Shopify looks beautifully positioned to me today over the next 20 years. We're going to keep our investments in. Ricky .  Most people are simply not investing. They are trading which is the antithesis of investing . We are holding for at least three years, preferably three decades and not any company. We are specifically focused on the rule breakers and innovators .  Ricky Mulvey: I just took early retirement because I bought and held Nvidia because you guys did through some thick and some thin. That to me is how to invest. Thanks for listening .

" In this podcast, Dylan Lewis and analysts Jason Moser and Bill Mann discuss the market and retail trends . What Jony Ive and Sam Altman are cooking up for hardware with OpenAI and io. MercadoLibrefounder and CEO Marcos Galperin stepping down . HowHome DepotandLowe'sare holding up until macro tailwinds return . Two stocks worth watching: Warby ParkerandPDD Holdings .  The Motley Fool's total average return is 957% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to167% for the S&P 500 . Consider when Netflixmade this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $639,271!  Open AI will be buying IO a device start-up led by famedAppledesigner Jony Ive . Jony and Jason Ive have apparently been in talks for a while . We've been thinking about AI generally in a software sense .  Open AI has the potential to be a threat to Apple given its apparent lack of progress in the AI space to date . Bill Mann: Building compelling devices that ultimately do something different than what we're used to doing today and then actually changing consumer behavior is really hard .  Some in the financial media are likening this toMetathen Facebook buying Instagram for $1 billion back when it was a 13 person company . At the end of the day, we're going to have to be a little patient with this IO development .  Jony Ive is probably the first person you'd want to be doing this, Bill Mann says . Jason Moser: We ultimately have no clue what they're thinking about, and it sounds like maybe they're still in that development stage .  MercadoLibre dropped earnings earlier this month . They weren't quite done with updates. The MercoLibre CEO says that has never happened before in consumer hardware .  Mercado Libre founder and CEO Marcos Galperin will step down from his leadership role . Irina, a listener from the Czech Republic, wrote us a note immediately after the news came out . Bill Mann: It sounds like the essence of how a transition should be conducted .  Howard Schultz left Starbucks at what you would think was the top, and it turned out to be at the top . Ariel Sharstin, the president of commerce, will be stepping into the role . Jason Moser: ""It seems like about as good an executive position as you could line up""  Mercado Libre, not necessarily a household name for a lot of folks who follow the US market . But zooming in on Gubern's tenure, he launched the company, co founder, took the company public, shares up roughly 9,000% .  When Mercado Libre launched, it was meant to be, and was described as the eBay of Latin America . Now it's so far beyond that. It became theAmazonof Latin America, which is not an easy place to build a business like this. e-commerce business now does hundreds of billions in total payment volume.  Sook Bum Kim still owns nearly a 9% stake in the company worth north of $4 billion . He controls close to 75% of total voting power there, according to the latest proxy that was just filed in April . Dylan Lewis: Bill Mann is the king of obscure stocks .  This is a bonus radar stock segment this show . We've got a lot more coming up later, in fact, the dollars and data on home improvement . Stay right here.  Target has completely lost its way and as we've seen in retail, if you are a retailer who has a little bit of fire in your brand, you're doing fine . 75% of Walmart's market share gains came from households that make $100,000 .  Home Depot had 60% exposure to China in 2017 . Today, that's about 30% and they feel that it will be under 25% by the end of next year . It seems like they're making progress on the digital front and then everything is going back to tariffs and how exposed these retailers are .  Bill Mann: Big ticket purchases, those $1,000 or more, that was actually up three tenths of a percentage point from a year ago . Mann: Comp average ticket was essentially flat and transactions only decreased about half a percent . The fact that they maintained guidance for the full year was a positive .  Some of that has to do with things being pulled forward because of COVID when we were sitting in our houses during the pandemic, staring at things that needed to be done . Also the higher rate environment eating into some home improvement projects that people might be financing .  Lowe's announced in April that they're acquiring artisan design group, say business focused on design, services, looking at flooring, cabinets, countertops . Dylan Lewis: It seems like they're integrating it nicely and it will absolutely just expand that network .  Both Home Depot and Home Depot are very smart retailers, Bill Mann says . Both recognize that the game for both of them is to make sure that they don't get disintermediated by somebody else rather than each other .  Home Depot is significantly larger in market cap, store footprint, and whatnot . Over the last five years, Lowe's has been the outperformer . But it was something that struck me when Marvin Ellison took over the CEO role at Lowe's, one of the main priorities was taking that cash cow business and returning some value to shareholders .  Home Depot's share repurchases brought that share account down about 8% . Lowe's, that share accounts down like 26% over the same time period . That whittles down that overall pie of shares outstanding making each share a little bit more valuable .  Trex CEO Bryan Fairbanks is the brand name in decking . Fairbanks talks about the company's recycled composite composite products . The company is on Shelves at Home Depot and Lowe's .  Bryan Fairbanks: ""Composite decking"" is a mixture of wood and recycled plastic . ""We have products that range anywhere from two dollars a linear foot to over $10 a . linear foot, depending upon the aesthetics of the product""  Trex has been doing this for over 35 years now. We stick to our knitting. We know what we're doing in the outdoor living area and we're proud of the products that we've put into the market over the years .  The product was picked up by both Lowe's and Home Depot . It's widely available across the country. We're be looking at over 6,000 locations where our product can be serviced .  Trex is primarily repair remodel. 90 to 95% of our business is repair and remodel . Trex has the largest footprint of areas where our product can be purchased .  Trex will be selling products direct into Home Depot and Lowe's stores . Trex also has a side of the business with Builders first source, USBM 84 Lumber . Most of those are going to be catering more to the pro business .  Bryan Fairbanks: About 5% of our total cost of goods sold are going to be potentially impacted by tariffs . Trex is primarily a North American-produced company, he says .  Think about gloves. Think about safety glasses. Virtually all of those are manufactured in Asia somewhere . Even when you are primarily a US manufacturer, we are not going to be immune from these tariffs . We'll start to see the impact on the direct purchasing over the next quarter .  Bryan Fairbanks: ""I'm very comfortable where we are, our ability to be able to mitigate it. Our supply chain team has already done a great job in identifying where they're coming from, being able to negotiate mitigating strategies""  A lot of talk about a potential recession on and off talk, Sanmeet Deo says . How does Trex navigate this potential recession scenario or in housing? Deo: ""We're taking a little bit of a step back and waiting to see where this all settles out""  Repair and remodel has slowed as well as the new home side of things, that's been stable, but we're still below where we need to be from a replacement cycle . Existing home sales continue to lag, but Trex has tended to perform better around recessionary times .  People have been underinvesting in their existing homes since the end of 2022 . By 2024, we hit the projected low spot about $1 per square foot of livable space . On average, that repair and remodel rate should be closer to $1.26 per sq. foot . By 2027, we'll be back to that average again .  Bryan Fairbanks: Trex has been in a trading range now for the better part of a couple years . As we start to see some of these economic metrics come back, we will start to . see a broader expansion of valuations in these companies .  Bryan Fairbanks: ""We have the profitability, we have the growth, and I think the stock will be back off to the races again"" Dylan Lewis: ""I'm more excited because of that pent-up demand. Pretty excited about that"" Jason Moser and Bill Mann join Fairbanks on our Motley Fool 24 member live stream .  Dylan Lewis and Bill Mann discuss the stocks on their radar this week .

A 0% purchase card allows you to make new purchases without paying interest for a set number of months . This can save you thousands compared with using a standard credit card . Tesco has a respectable 'Goldilocks' deal for 18 months at 0%.  If you take out a 0% purchase card with a 10-month interest-free period and spend £2,000 on new appliances, you’ll clear the debt before the interest kicks in . M&S and Barclaycard have the longest 0% purchases deals currently, at 24 months .  A cashback credit card rewards you with a percentage of your spending, effectively giving you back some of what you spend . If your card offers 1% cashback and you spend £100 on groceries, you'll earn £1 back . This cashback is typically credited to your account or added to your statement .  Points are usually earned based on the amount you spend and the class of your ticket . You can use points to cover the cost of flights or upgrades, though taxes and fees may still apply . American Express Premium Plus Card offers 30,000 Avios when you spend £6,000 in three months . Barclaycard Avios Plus Card gives 25,000 points for spending £3,000 .  Most credit and debit cards charge around 3% on foreign transactions, meaning a £100 purchase abroad could cost you £103 . Specialist travel cards waive those fees, letting you spend abroad at the same rates your bank gets . Virgin Atlantic fans can earn 18,000 points with their first purchase within 90 days .

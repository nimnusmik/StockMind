" Meta Platforms reported Q1 earnings per share (EPS) of $6.43, more than a dollar higher than what Wall Street analysts were expecting . Microsoft beat expectations on both the top and bottom-line in part due to the strength of their Azure cloud segment . Amazon and Apple posted impressive results for the quarter, but their forward looking guidance was less than rosy .  Microsoft increased their capex forecast for 2025, now anticipated to put roughly $80B into the buildout of their AI data centers .

Eight companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, all of which are later than usual and therefore have negative results .  Ford Motor Company (F), The Clorox Company (CLX), IQVIA Holdings (IQV), Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Johnson Controls (JCI), Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) and ConocoPhillips (COP) are all on our list for this week .

" AI chips and related hardware will receive the largest allocation of infrastructure spend over the next five years . Ongoing spending from cloud hyperscalers underscores strong commitment to data center buildouts and GPUs . These spending dynamics bode particularly well for semiconductor stocks .

Integrating large language models (LLMs) and generative AI into their ecosystems has supercharged growth for megacap tech .

Each company plays a mission-critical role in the development of AI-powered services . The chart below illustrates the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples .  Many investors are sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what management teams have to say in terms of financial guidance over the next quarter or second half of the year . As McKinsey models in its reporting, spending on AI infrastructure -- particularly chips and data centers -- should continue to experience robust growth . For these reasons, I would take advantage of any weakness among these chip stocks .  Now is the best time to buy before it’s too late, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon .

" Warren Buffett is retiring from Berkshire Hathaway, but the portfolio of stocks he built still offers insights into great investment opportunities . Amazon continues to dominate U.S. e-commerce and cloud computing . American Express has been a Buffett favorite for decades .  Amazon has 40% of the U.S. e-commerce market, outpacing Walmart's 7% . North American sales have also been very strong lately, jumping 8% in the most recent quarter to $93 billion . Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts for about 63% of parent company's total operating income .  Amazon's cloud platform gives it an edge in cloud computing . The stock's trailing price-to-earnings ratio is 34, a bit higher than theS&P 500's 28 but cheaper than Walmart's 40 P/E . American Express continues to grow even as some investors have worried that early impacts of President Trump's tariffs could slow spending .  Much of the company's growth has come from its ability to collect higher fees from its members . American Express stock is relatively inexpensive with a price-to-earnings multiple of just 21 . The market has been volatile over the past couple of months and there's still uncertainty surrounding tariffs and the economy .  On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a“Double Down” stockrecommendation for companies that they think are about to pop .

" United Parcel Service operates at the epicenter of the trade war situation since it helps to deliver packages all over the world . At its current share price, the logistics giant offers investors a huge 6.4% yield . That payout is backed by 16 straight annual dividend increases .  UPS has lost more than half of its value from the peak it hit in early 2022 . Management has been closing facilities, modernizing facilities and working with its union to iron out a new labor deal . The big goal is to boost profitability, and management has had some success on that front .  UPS announced that it was going to materially curtail its relationship with its largest customer, Amazon.com . The business UPS does with Amazon isn't very profitable, so that low-margin business was likely to dwindle over time, anyway . The current White House administration's fluctuating tariff policies have created uncertainty in global trade relationships .  UPS has plenty of work ahead of it as it continues to streamline its business . It will notably include trying to adjust to handling materially less package volume thanks to its shift away from Amazon deliveries .  First-quarter 2025 revenues and operating profits were up year over year . UPS still appears to be executing well despite everything it faces . That should make it an interesting investment option for those who are willing to venture into turnaround situations .

" Investors can often simplify their investment choices by buying stock in established, wealth-building companies . These large-cap stocks have not only stayed at the top of industries they helped transform but have also focused on plans that can keep them on a growth trajectory for years to come .  Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit is the world's largest cloud services provider . Amazon also has a lucrative advertising business that generated $56 billion in annual revenue in 2024 .  Amazon already utilizes nearly 1 million robots supporting its warehouse and logistics operations . As the company scales up its use of robots, Amazon should realize increased profits as its margins expand . Investors looking for a long-term buy-and-hold candidate shouldn't overlook Amazon stock .  The Taiwan-based semiconductor giant jumped to a technical lead in the last decade as chip design companies turned to outside fabs . The company plans to spend approximately $40 billion in capital expenditures (capex) in 2025 .  TSMC generated almost $26 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2025, a 42% yearly increase . That led to comprehensive income of nearly $12 billion in Q1, rising 47% over the same period . Its stock trades at a 25 price-to-earnings ratio .  Alphabet reported 10% year-over-year growth in Google Search ad revenue in Q1 2025 . Google Cloud's revenue grew by 28% and operating income by over 140% . Waymo is performing over 250,000 weekly autonomous rides, up fivefold compared to a year ago .

" Amazon Web Services makes up the majority of Amazon's profits . Cloud computing is expected to undergo large growth over the next few years . With Amazon maturing as a company, investors are starting to care less about growth and more about profits .  During Q1, Amazon's North American segment (including divisions tied to e-commerce) saw its sales rise 8% year over year but only delivered a6.3% operating margin . However, AWS delivers a one-two punch of growth and profits . AWS accounted for 63% of Amazon's total operating profits in Q1 .  AWS is the market share leader in cloud computing, benefiting from its position as the first major player in the space . AI is the latest trend in the cloud computing space and is currently a massive boost for AWS . Many businesses still have on-site computing, networking, and storage .  AWS is the driving factor behind Amazon's stock, and the industry is expected to experience phenomenal growth over the next few years . Grand View Research found the size of the cloud computing market was around $750 billion in 2024 . As a result, AWS is another winner of the AI arms race .

" Stocks entered the green for the year as investors cheered the US-China trade thaw . The ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks continued theirrenewed ascent . Earnings from economic bellwethers Cisco (CSCO) and Walmart (WMT) didn't completely suck .  Ex-Medtronic CEO Bill George says CEOs should get away from corporate guidance . He says earnings estimates and corporate guidance are useless in a backdrop where one social media post could blow up company's financial planning .  Walmart reiterated its full-year earnings per share forecast on Thursday after ratcheting down expectations at an investor event several weeks ago . Executives went on to say they would start raising prices (by raising prices)  If tariffs go back to pre-thaw levels, it may render guidance obsolete . Yet, the guidance is out there . Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz decided to pull guidance altogether because of trade uncertainty . United Airlines (UAL) still has its double guidance range out there(which numerous execs have privately made fun of). Yet despite all the confusion, we have the Street looking for earnings growth north of 10% this year .  Earnings estimates and guidance have historically proven to be important drivers of stock prices . To the extent they no longer are, I view it as one more problem for investors to contend with in a challenging 2025 .",negative,"earnings, executives, stocks, stock, forecast"
" Warren Buffett has steered the Berkshire Hathaway to market-crushing returns since 1965 . An investment of $1,000 in Berkshire stock in 1965 would have been worth $44.7 million at the end of 2024 . The same investment in theS&P 500 index would have grown to just $342,906 over the same period .  Buffett's brand of long-term investing, which focuses on companies with steady growth, reliable profitability, and strong management teams, is likely to endure . With that said, three existing holdings, which make up 32.9% of Berkshire's $286 billion portfolio, are using AI to supercharge their legacy businesses .  Amazon created its own family of large language models (LLMs) called Nova, which the company claims can save developers up to 75% on costs compared to using other third-party models on the AWS Bedrock platform . Then there is the Amazon Q AI assistant, which is embedded into AWS, which can help businesses analyze their internal data .  Coca-Cola has used AI to create content for interactive marketing campaigns, and even to create a new promotional beverage . In 2024, in 2024, ""everything will be generative AI"" eventually, says Pratik Thakar .  Coca-Cola signed a deal to spend $1.1 billion over five years withMicrosoftAzure to integrate AI into its manufacturing processes, its supply chains, and deeper into its marketing strategies . Buffett and his team spent approximately $38 billion accumulatingApple shares between 2016 and 2023 . That position was worth over $170 billion, accounting for around half of Berkshire's entire portfolio .  Apple has been preparing for the AI revolution for years . The company designs its own chips, and the latest versions for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers were crafted with AI workloads in mind . Apple Intelligence provides users with powerful new writing tools, allowing them to summarize lengthy emails and text messages with a single click .  There are more than 2.35 billion active Apple devices worldwide, so the company could become the biggest distributor of AI to consumers .

" Nvidia has a history of beating Wall Street's earnings estimates . Hints from several major customers are encouraging about the demand for Nvidia's GPUs . Strong demand could boost Nvidia's Q1 results and its outlook for the rest of the year .  Nvidia has topped consensus Wall Street earnings estimates in each of the previous four quarters by at least 5%. Granted, an earnings beat doesn't always translate to a bump in Nvidia's share price . But my hunch is that investors are looking for a reason to be bullish about the once high-flying stock again .  Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in his company's Q1 earnings call that Amazon Web Services has been aggressive in installing Nvidia AI chips as well as its own Trainium chips . Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and its parentAlphabet, highlighted Google's ties with Nvidia . CFO Amy Hood said in her Q3 earnings call, that demand is outpacing capacity for AI services .  Nvidia plans to launch its Blackwell Ultra GPU in the second half of this year . Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated in his company's last quarterly update that demand for the new GPUs is ""extraordinary"" Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer Nvidia's B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs to customers .  Nvidia could beat earnings expectations and provide an optimistic outlook for the rest of the year . But if the trade dynamics change for the worse between now and May 28, that might not be enough to propel the stock higher over the near term . Over the long term, I think Nvidia's future remains bright .  Nvidia, Apple, Netflix and Netflix are all about to pop . If you invest $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you'd have $351,127!

" Amazon's two growth segments can help propel it to a $10 trillion market cap . Compared to other big tech competitors, it has more room to expand profit margins in the next decade . Amazon's dual growth engines and profit margin expansion potential have the company poised to be the first stock to eclipse a $100 trillion valuation .  Amazon's combined North America and international sales were more than $500 billion over the last year . E-commerce is still less than 20% of retail sales in the United States and has steadily grown for decades . Cloud computing is getting supercharged by artificial intelligence (AI), which is taking the industry to become much bigger .  Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is going to capture the majority of the company's planned $100 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 . I think AWS has a clear path to expand to $200 billion and eventually $300 billion in revenue over the next decade and beyond .  Amazon's combined revenue will eventually reach $2 trillion in the next 10 to 20 years . Amazon's competitors in big tech do not have the large addressable market afforded to Amazon by dominating both e-commerce and cloud computing . Amazon has a much clearer revenue growth path to help it achieve the hundreds of billions of dollars in annual earnings needed to warrant this valuation .

" President Trump's blanket imposition of worldwide tariffs last month sent much of the market into free fall . Astute investors viewed the wide-ranging sell-off as a buying opportunity .

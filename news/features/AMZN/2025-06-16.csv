" Most of Amazon’s history and legacy is in e-commerce . Online shopping was only a launching point for a much more encompassing operation . Flexibility and a willingness to accept failure means the company will always have relevant profit centers and growth drivers .  Amazon is thee-commercepowerhouse of the Western world, accounting for roughly 40% of the U.S. online shopping spend . It reported revenue of $638 billion last year, up 11% . Few companies come close to those kinds of numbers, which is why Amazon sports the world's fourth-biggest market cap of just under $2.3 trillion .  Amazon has room left to continue growing well into the distant future . Jeff Bezos launched the company out of his garage in 1995 . He's been critiqued by former and current employees as challenging to work for .  Bezos was working with a clear understanding of the business realities surrounding him . He wasn't afraid to try an unlimited number of new things knowing many of them might end in failure . His only request was that experiments should ""fail fast"" so teams can move on to the next new project .  Amazon's cloud computing arm wasn't launched until 2006 -- well after its e-commerce operation was thriving . That experiment worked . So did 2005's debut of Amazon Prime, along with the recent ramp-up of its digital advertising business .  Amazon may have failed more often than it's succeeded, but it's willing to end what's not working and double-down on what is . General Electric used to be much like Amazon, in that it could manage many different businesses . GE has since been split up into several different stand-alone companies, mostly as a means of compartmentalizing its collapse .  Amazon is a low-debt company built from the ground up to thrive on change . It could be just as fairly viewed as a private equity outfit, with the flexibility and capacity to adapt to whatever unknowns the future may hold . The fact that Amazon stock is still 12% below its February peak provides a quantitative reason this name's a buy here .

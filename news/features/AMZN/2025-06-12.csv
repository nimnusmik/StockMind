Musk said Tesla would start the new self-driving car service in Austin as soon as June 22 .

Musk predicts hundreds of thousands of the vehicles will be on the road by late 2026 .  The initial operation area will likely cover only a few square miles, a source says . The rules governing driverless vehicles in Texas are notably light . Texas is popular choice for companies in early stages of autonomous service .  Tesla has embraced a different approach to autonomy, favoring a camera-only system rather than a combination of lidar, radar and pre-mapping that competitors use . Musk has long claimed such an approach will allow the company to scale up sooner than rivals including Waymo, which he considers too expensive .  Tesla has been in touch with Austin city officials and first responders to discuss safety expectations . The company has said robotaxis will be remotely monitored initially . Last week, Waymo drove into a flooded area following a storm .  Elon Musk's public spat with President Trump threatens to alienate even more customers .

" One couple that's worth $2.7 million recently shared that dividend investing is not the best strategy for young investors . ""Focusing on total returns is a more efficient strategy,"" they explained .  Some dividend investors chase high yields and end up with low total returns . Most companies that give out cash distributions to investors are mature companies that have their best growth days behind them . Dividend stocks make more sense when you need cash flow to cover living expenses and want to reduce your risk .  Dividends are taxed at long-term capital gains tax rates . However, you can avoid taxes on your stocks entirely by investing in reliable companies that don't give out dividends . Giving out high yields limits how much a company can reinvest in high-growth initiatives .  Some investors don't want to give up on dividend investing as a whole, even if they recognize that they could get higher returns elsewhere . Dividend growth investing is a strategy that prioritizes high dividend growth rates over the present yield . Many of these same companies hike the dividend by more than 10% per year .

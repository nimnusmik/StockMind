Analyst: ""Management talked about accelerating “growth” so much on the call that it felt like we were in the middle of a game of Waldo?”  Salesforce reported better than feared results, but the FY2026 outlook adjusting for foreign exchange and the first quarter beat was lowered vs. the initial guide as growth in the core cloud segments continues to decelerate . Salesforce's current bookings growth of 16.3% is more than double our estimate .  Salesforce's cRPO growth was 1 point better than expected, however, the second quarter guide came in slightly lighter than expected with the outlook implying single digit constant currency growth which would be the first time in company history .

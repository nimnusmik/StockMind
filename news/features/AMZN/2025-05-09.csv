" Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin rocket company scored a $2.4 billion contract from the US Space Force to loft military satellites into space . The award was a coup for Bezos and showed it was finally playing in the same league as Elon Musk's SpaceX . Musk, his longtime rival, has the ear of President Donald Trump .  The Trump administration’s proposed budget would cut NASA funding by 24% and potentially kill a moon mission Blue Origin is building a lander for . SpaceX is also looking to influence the regulator governing Amazon.com's Project Kuiper satellite internet service . “Elon has both feet inside the door and is calling the shots,” says Bill Goodman, the chief executive officer of .  Bezos has adopted a lower profile even as tech executives like Mark Zuckerberg have continued to visit the White House and lobby Trump directly . Amazon donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, where Bezos mingled with the chiefs of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet .  As recently as last spring, Bezos was doing little to ingratiate himself with Trump . Some associates are betting disagreements with the administration over trade and immigration will eventually break up the bromance .  Musk has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the Trump campaign . The billionaire owns X, the social media platform he owns, to enthusiastically endorse Trump for a second term . Bezos arranged a call with Trump to recommend Doug Burgum as a vice presidential candidate .  Bezos has been a space nerd since boyhood . He founded Blue Origin in 2000, with a goal of lowering the cost of space exploration by creating reusable rockets . Musk had similar aspirations when he founded SpaceX about two years later .  Bezos devotes as much as 10 hours a day to meetings at Blue Origin . He's rarely sighted at Seattle headquarters these days, and prefers to keep in touch with executives by phone . Bezos has sought to impose discipline on the company and build a credible rival to SpaceX .  Blue Origin has filed at least two protests seeking to overturn federal contracts with SpaceX . In the last 11 years, SpaceX has won as much as $25 billion in US government contracts to Blue Origin’s roughly $6 billion .  Blue Origin is determined to demonstrate its bona fides with the Artemis program, NASA’s planned mission to return people to the Moon . But Musk has long seen Mars as a worthier goal and has routinely showed up at Trump events wearing an “Occupy Mars” t-shirt .  Isaacman pledged not to abandon the agency’s multibillion-dollar Moon push and send astronauts to Mars instead . He said he hadn’t been in contact with Musk about his plans to manage the agency . The administration's proposed budget would add $1 billion for Mars .  Amazon is struggling to build satellites quickly enough to meet the deadline . The company will probably have to seek an extension from the Federal Communications Commission . SpaceX suggested that the agency stop granting extensions for satellite operators .  Bezos will have to carefully tend his relationship with Trump . Goodman recommends that he look for opportunities where Blue Origin can work with SpaceX and show Trump and Musk that his main goal is to help advance space exploration .

" The S&P 500 delivered a return of 25% (including dividends) last year, but had you invested in the VOOG instead, you would have earned a much higher return of 35.9% . The Vanguard ETF is down slightly more than the S.P 500 this year but I predict it will recover and beat the index again in 2025 . Last year's result wasn't a one-off because the Vanguard ETF has outperformed the index every year .  Nvidia is the largest holding in the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF . Nvidia grew its revenue by 114% during its last fiscal year, and its stock more than doubled in both 2023 and 2024 .  Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon just reported their financial results for the first quarter of 2025 . Each company exceeded Wall Street's expectations at the top and bottom line . Their cloud computing segments continued to deliver rapid growth, led by soaring demand for artificial intelligence (AI) services .  The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 15.4% since it was established in 2010 . The high-growth segments of the stock market were trading at elevated valuations heading into President Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcements .  President Trump has already paused the more aggressive ""reciprocal tariffs"" he imposed on America's trading partners . Many of the products sold by the top holdings in the Vanguard ETF aren't affected by tariffs . Semiconductors are exempt, for example, much to the benefit of companies like Nvidia andBroadcom .  Tech giants are likely to hold up better than the rest of the market because of the composition of their product portfolios, their enormous scale, and their strong balance sheets . As a result, I think there is a very high chance the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF recovers to beat the S.P 500 yet again in 2025 .  Stock Advisor’s total average return is893% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to162% for the S&P 500 . If you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $695,897!

" Amazon reported a phenomenal first quarter, but the market is worried about guidance and tariffs . Management explained why it's optimistic about the tariff situation . Amazon stock trades at a low price-to-earnings multiple, but it's already up from recent lows . If you look down the road a few years, this dip looks like an excellent buying opportunity .  Earnings per share rose from $0.98 last year to $1.59 this year, easily beating Wall Street's expectation . But the market got hung up on second-quarter guidance . Management is guiding for sales to increase 9% year over year but for a potential decrease in operating income .  Jassy didn't whitewash the potential effects of tariffs on the first-quarter earnings call . He said that so far, demand has not attenuated, and there has been a streak of higher buying in some categories . Amazon is one of the largest grocers in the world, selling $100 billion in groceries last year .  Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue increased 17% year over year in the first quarter . It's seeing growth both from generative artificial intelligence (AI) business as well as non-generative AI business .  Amazon stock fell after earnings, but its P/E ratio has remained steady around 30 . That means the market thinks Amazon is fairly valued at this price, and the negativity is built into the stock price . With management's encouraging stance on tariffs and plenty of long-term opportunities, the stock might start to climb back up soon .

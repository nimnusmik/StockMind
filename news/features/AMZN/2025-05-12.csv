" Artificial Intelligence (AI) has helped Palantir redefine its business over the last two years . The company's main growth catalyst is now the private sector .

Palantir's dominance in the software realm over the last couple of years, coupled with a bullish overall sentiment around the AI opportunity, explains the stock's incredible rise . The company is also signing more meaningful deals, underscored by consistently rising revenue and widening profit margins .  Palantir is one of the priciest stocks in the software space today, and history suggests that shares are due for a pullback . The average consensus price target among analysts is about $94, suggesting about 21% downside . Back in the late 1990s, internet stocks were experiencing their own moment of euphoria .  Palantir's valuation multiples will likely compress over the next couple of years . Investors should prepare for some valuation compression in the near term .

Nvidia remains well positioned to dominate the AI infrastructure market over the coming years . For these reasons, I think Nvidia stock will soar following its earnings report later this month .

" The World Economic Forumpredicts that 92 million roles will be displaced by current technological trends, but that 170 million new jobs will be created . For those who don't have the economic power, or the intellectual interest, to get a master’s degree in AI and machine learning, what does the bot-filled future look like for them?  Amazon's new Vulcan robot that can “feel’s” can pick up items stored in the middle of a warehouse . Amazon says it is training a small number of warehouse workers to become robot technicians .  Amazon says it's offering a job retraining program for some workers to gain robotic maintenance skills . Amazon didn’t say so, this would obviously not be a 1:1 conversion . It wouldn't require an army of humans to oversee the robots in the same way it needs them to fulfill warehouse orders .  Running robots becomes like operating a PC: Pretty much everyone needs to know how to do it to be employable . Bots could remain the purview of only the biggest and most deep-pocketed companies . The vast majority of retail, restaurants, and driving jobs continue to be done by humans .  Amazon is offering a glimpse at new jobs in an AI-bot world today . The company is hoping to use Amazon's cloud computing to create new jobs for humans .",neutral,"robots, robot, robotic, ai, jobs"

" If you invested in Amazon at the start of any year over the last 20 years, you'd be up on your investment five years later, every time . Amazon's retail and cloud-computing business is growing at a triple-digit pace . The market for Amazon's biggest moneymaker could more than quintuple over the next two decades .  Amazon had net sales of nearly $100 billion in the first quarter of 2025 alone . The company has many moving parts, so honing in on just retail operations is challenging . With its massive customer base, as well as sprawling infrastructure for logistics and shipping, I don't believe anyone will meaningfully disrupt Amazon anytime soon .  Amazon Web Services (AWS) has generated $112 billion in trailing-12-month net sales . But investors shouldn't think that growth is peaking simply because of its already gargantuan scale . AWS is a leading platform in the cloud-computing space, which Jassy expects to quintuple .  The company's main retail business will be fine, in spite of tariff headwinds . And AWS is poised for a decade or more of solid growth . Amazon's AI business is growing at a greater than 100% annual pace and is generating billions of dollars in annual net sales .  Amazon's profits should grow dramatically as it grows, thanks to AI and a shift in IT spending to the cloud . It might not show up immediately in 2025 -- patience is still important . But I'm comfortable in my belief that Amazon's . profits will be meaningfully higher in five years, which will likely send the stock higher .

Miller doesn't believe Tesla is a bad company, but he says it's too expensive . Miller: ""They're going to have to knock the cover off the ball in terms of self-driving cars and AI""  Much of Tesla's valuation seems to depend on future initiatives .

" The long-term investing thesis for Amazon remains as strong as it was when the stock was hitting all-time highs . Google parent Alphabet faces big challenges, but it should also continue to be a big winner . The Trade Desk is still the leader in a market with huge growth potential .  Amazon's shares are 22% below the high from earlier this year at the time of this writing . This sell-off is due to concerns about the negative impacts oftariffs . I suspect Amazon's business could hold up better than many expect . Exorbitant tariff levels will almost certainly be temporary .  Amazon remains as solid as it was when its share price was hitting all-time highs just a few months ago . E-commerce still has a lot of room to expand. Organizations will continue shifting their IT spending to the cloud. Artificial intelligence (AI) will remain a massive tailwind. Amazon is poised to benefit from all these trends .  The antitrust rulings could cause major headaches for Google . But I wouldn't get the cart before the horse: Alphabet just might come out in better shape than expected . Betting against Google in search or AI is ill-advised in my view .  The Trade Desk's share price has cratered this year . The adtech stock is down almost 60% from its record high hit in the fourth quarter of 2024 . But don't play a funeral dirge for this one-time highflier . I think the Trade Desk could be like the mythical phoenix rising from the ashes .  This adtech stock's crisis presents a great opportunity for long-term investors . If my answers to these questions are right, buying The Trade Desk now should pay off handsomely over the coming years .

" Amazon has tremendous growth opportunities in e-commerce, cloud services, AI, and more . The company is a financial juggernaut, with Wall Street projecting accelerating earnings growth . Amazon is the ultimate growth stock to buy with $1,000 right now .  Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in October 2024 that his company only claims around 1% of the global retail market . He added that 80% to 85% of that market segment share lives in physical stores . I suspect Jassy is right about the big e-commerce opportunity . He also thinks he's right about growth prospects for the cloud services market .  Artificial intelligence (AI) presents a massive growth opportunity for Amazon beyond AWS . Amazon continues to expand further into healthcare, recently announcing the ability to fill pet medication prescriptions on Amazon Pharmacy . The company's Zoox should have significant growth prospects in the robotaxi market .  Amazon posted a Q1 profit of $17.1 billion, up more than 64% year over year . Analysts project the company will increase its sales to a whopping $762 billion in 2026 . Amazon generatedfree cash flow of $25.9 billion over the 12 months ended March 31, 2025 to $155.7 billion .  Forward-looking investors should take advantage of the pullback in Amazon's share price, in my opinion . This ultimate growth stock might not be available at a discount for too much longer .

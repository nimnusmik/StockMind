Axon is improving public safety and delivering monster returns to investors .  Amazon is the top name in two industries, an incredible feat for a company that started out as a bookseller . It has the lead in U.S. e-commerce by a wide margin, with no chance of any competitor taking over in the foreseeable future . Amazon is pioneering many of the most potent generative AI programs, primarily through the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment .

" The big winner of the first phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has clearly been Nvidia . As competition heats up in the AI chips market, cloud services providers could benefit . As the AI revolution rolls on, other companies may supplant Nvidia .  In 2022, Nvidia generated about $27 billion in revenue . As of its most recent quarter, the company reported $130 billion . That's shockingly fast growth, and it's often cited for why Nvidia's share price has risen 800% .  As the market for AI chips becomes more saturated, who will benefit? My investing instincts point to one of the big buyers of AI chips . Amazon, through its Amazon Web Services division, controls around 30% of the cloud services market . Amazon's market share is roughly equal to Microsoft's combined AI chip market share .  Next phase of AI revolution could see the focus shift away from AI infrastructure (GPUs) and toward practical AI . Amazon stock, with its leading position in that key market, could ultimately outperform Nvidia stock in the long term . The cloud infrastructure market is enormous (ataround $700 billion) and red-hot, growing at around 15% year over year .

While Broadcom is seeing strong growth from its networking portfolio, its biggest opportunity lies in helping customers develop custom AI chips . Biggest risk: A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending .  Palantir Technologies' AI platform (AIP) has been gaining strong momentum in the U.S. commercial sector . The platform helps organizations gather data from a variety of sources and organize it into an ""ontology"" that connects the data to real-world assets and processes .  While some see AI as a risk, more likely than not, it will be a growth driver for the company .Pinterest has spent the last few years investing heavily to help transform its platform into one that is both more engaging and shoppable .  Philip Morris International is being led by its portfolio of smokeless products that includes the nicotine pouch Zyn and premium heated tobacco product Iqos . Since it does not sell its cigarettes in the U.S., this business has held up well .  e.l.f. Beauty has been one of the fastest-growing cosmetic brands in the mass-market space over the past several years . The company bought Hailey Bieber's emerging Rhode brand .

" The Motley Fool analysts Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger talk about Amazon and Walmart . They discuss why they're considering launching their own stablecoins . Two dividend stocks Matt thinks are worth getting on your radar: WhirlpoolandOwens Corning .  Amazon and Walmart's potential stablecoin aspirations . Roku and Amazon are teaming up in the ad market . We'll also take a look at a couple of Matt's favorite dividend stocks .  Oil prices are up today as the conflict between Israel and Iran continues . Iran is signaling that it seeks an end to hostilities and wants to resume talks over its nuclear programs . The Federal Reserve Interest rate decision is out on Wednesday at 2:00PM, with Chairman Powell's press conference to follow .  Amazon and Walmart are looking at ways to possibly issue their own stablecoins . This could have an impact on payments companies like Visa and Mastercard . Matthew Argersinger: This is appealing to someone who might live outside the US or is doing cross-border transactions .  Jason Moser: It's a smart move for Amazon and Walmart to get involved in crypto transactions . He says it could potentially save billions in processing fees that these retailers would otherwise pay to Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and banks . Moser says it's a peg to the relative stability of the dollar without actually having to be in dollars .  It does seem like we really need more in the way of consumer protections, some type of regulatory framework if stablecoins are going to become a meaningful medium of exchange . Visa and Mastercard are already partnering with crypto platforms to offer cards that allow you to spend against your stablecoin balance .  Matthew Argersinger: The longer you own these stocks, it seems like the more sense it makes . But let's look out over the next five years, particularly in this evolving space, he says . He says stablecoins are a drop in the bucket, compared to Visa and Mastercard's network .  Jason Moser: I'm the last person who says big, dominant companies can't be disrupted . But over the next five years, I don't see it happening with Visa and Mastercard . Moser says it's not clear what consumers get out of using stablecoins .  Amazon and Roku are teaming up to extend their relationship with Roku . This partnership will allow advertisers to reach roughly 80 million connected TV households through Amazon's demand-side platform . This seems like a space where we're seeing more partnerships in order to take advantage of this massive opportunity .  Amazon is now operating on basically an $80 billion annual run rate with their advertising business . Jason Moser: Clearly, they've built out, I think, ways to win on both sides. Whether it's that demand-side platform or just through the content that they're slinging us through their many channels. This seems to make a lot of sense.  The revenue in the advertising video demand space is expected to reach better than $54 billion this year . It's projected to hit $71.3 billion by 2029. It's growing, and part of that has to do with the value proposition .  Matthew Argersinger: Roku's shares have had a tough go over the last five years . He says it's a big opportunity, but it's also a very competitive space . He asks: Do you see this from these levels today as potentially a market beater over next five years?  Jason Moser: I think this expanded partnership with Amazon is definitely a good step . But is Roku a good bet in the long run? Moser says based on its track record as a public company, it doesn't appear to be a good investment . Moser also says he's happy being a shareholder in Amazon and the Trade Desk .  Matthew Argersinger: How a company has grown its dividend, the growth rate of the dividend over time, and has that growth exceeded inflation on an annual basis? He says that is a tell that the company's growing its earnings, it's becoming a more profitable, more valuable company, and it's showing up in their dividends . Check out the payout ratio, which is a good proxy for company's growth .  Matthew Argersinger likes to see a payout ratio below 70%, even below 60% to be safe . Jason Moser: There are two that stand out to me right now, and both are fortunately or unfortunately tied to the housing market . Both these can be winning investments from here, but they would do a lot better, Jason says .  Owens Corning is a leader in roofing and insulation . Management is targeting one billion in combined dividends and buybacks each of the next two years . Whirlpool is North America's leading kitchen, bathroom appliance maker .  Whirlpool stock has suffered over the last several years . It trades for less than 10 times forward earnings and has a dividend yield of almost 8%. It's a little bit riskier than Owens Corning, but I like the value and the turnaround potential .  Matthew Argersinger: If I had to pick one for the short run, I might go with Whirlpool . I just think its business is less cyclical. It's much more tied to refurbishment and replacement . Jason Moser: Do these really just represent a nice way to get a good risk exposure?  John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors . Matthew Argersinger and Jason Moser have positions in Amazon, Home Depot, Mastercard, Netflix, Owens Corning, Roku, The Trade Desk, Visa, and Whirlpool .

" Nvidia is considered an international leader in the design and manufacturing of computer chips and helped revolutionize the rise of artificial intelligence . The company announced plans this March for aquantum research center in Boston .  RIVA 128 allowed for support of high-resolution 2D and 3D graphics, and over a million units sold in its first four months of sales . Two years later, onJan. 22, 1999, Nvidia went public on the New York Stock Exchange at $12 a share .  In 1999, Nvidia released GeForce 256, the world’s first “Graphics Processing Unit.” By marketing the chip directly to customers, the chip popularized the term “GPU” Nvidia joined the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 in 2001 .  Nvidia's CUDA chip allows users to use chips for purposes other than gaming . Investors initially gave the company the benefit of the doubt for the first five years of the CUDA investment . Later technological developments would make CUDA crucial to Nvidia .  In 2012, students used CUDA to train the visual-recognition neural networkAlexNet with two Nvidia GPUs . The breakthrough performance in identifying images demonstrated that using GPUs to train machine learning models cut training times significantly .  In March 2022, Nvidia announced the H100 ‘Hopper’ chip, promising faster training and better performance . Major companies, including Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) turned to Nvidia with billions as they began to develop AI and data-driven products . In November 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a language model built on Nvidia GPUs that quickly reached headlines .  Nvidia's revenue for the quarter ending in January 2024 more than doubled year over year . The company announced a 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024 . Nvidia announced its next chip, Blackwell, in March 2023 .  Nvidia passed Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company at $3.3 trillion . In 2018, it faced a class-action lawsuitalleging it did not properly disclose to investors the impact of the cryptocurrency market on revenue from sales of its GPUs . Nvidia paid a$5.5 million settlement in 2022 to the SEC because of the issue .  Global chip shortage occurred in early 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and an increased reliance on technology for remote work . President Trump announcedProject Stargate in January 2025, which involves tech companies such as Oracle (ORCL), OpenAI, and SoftBank (SFTBY) investing $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the United States over the next four years .  In April 2025, Trump banned the export of Nvidia's H20 chip to China . Nvidia stock dropped $589 billion, almost 17%, marking the largest single-day loss in stock market history .

" Data centres will consume 114.8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a year . This is equivalent to the power consumed by more than 42,500 UK households . It exceeds the number of homes in Burnley, which stood at 41,955 after the most recent Census .  Documents name Amazon Data Services UK as the site’s eventual operator . Project would sit on an empty 22-acre greenfield site . Plans also include 140 solar panels but it is not clear how much power they will supply to the data centres .  AWS set out plans last September to invest £8bn in the UK to build data centres . Such developments require vast amounts of energy that puts it at odds with the Government’s mission to become net zero by 2050 . The investment was hailed by Rachel Reeves as ‘the start of the economic revival’  Amazon is opaque about how much of Houghton Regis’ water it will suck up in order to cool the IT equipment . Oliver Hayes, head of policy and campaigns at Global Action Plan, said: “It’s astonishing that communities are expected to like it or lump it when it comes to this wave of giant data centres”",neutral,"aws, data, kilowatt, 8bn, amazon"
" While pure-play quantum stocks have soared 500% or more recently, the real winner may be hiding in plain sight . Amazon's dual approach captures both hardware development upside and cloud infrastructure opportunity . Artificial intelligence could compress decades of quantum research into years, creating a massive opportunity for the platform .  Conventional wisdom says practical quantum computing remains decades away . Amazon is the most overlooked opportunity in the market for quantum computing . IBM plans to deliver its fault-tolerant quantum computer, Starling, by 2029 .  AWS Braket, launched in 2019, enables developers to access quantum computers from D-Wave, IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and others through the cloud . Amazon profits regardless of which hardware ultimately wins . The company's Center for Quantum Computing at Caltech is developing its own quantum processors .  Amazon offers something these pure plays can't: a profitable business generating nearly $700 billion in annual revenue . Over $1.25 billion poured into quantum start-ups in Q1 2025 alone .  If quantum computing takes another decade to mature, AWS will keep printing money from traditional cloud services . Fortune 500 companies are spending real money to explore quantum's potential . If quantum becomes a $100 billion market by 2035 and AWS captures even 30% that's $30 billion in high-margin revenue .  Investors looking for quantum upside without the moonshot risk don't need to chase cash-flow-negative companies . Amazon offers something far more powerful -- a platform that profits from the entire ecosystem, combined with a mountain of revenue . The real winner may not be the one building the quantum computer, but the one powering them all .

" Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, TSMC, and ASML are all strong plays on expanding AI infrastructure . Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are three tech titans set to benefit from AI . Palantir and Salesforce are two leading software companies that have big AI opportunities ahead .  AMD has become a leader in central processing units (CPUs), which act as the brains of the operation, within the data center . The company has also carved out a niche for its GPUs with AI inference, which is less technically demanding than training AI models .  Broadcom sees its three furthest-along customers as having between a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market in fiscal 2027 . This is a huge opportunity for Broadcom . While the above three companies design advanced AI chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSMC)is the one they hire to actually make them .  ASML has a virtual monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography . It also introduced its next-generation technology, high-NA (numerical aperture) EUV, that will allow for higher density chips . While TSMC has balked at the high price ($400 million) of these new machines, it cannot afford to get bypassed on the technological front by a competitor likeIntel .  Amazon is using AI throughout its e-commerce operations to make its business more efficient and reduce costs . Meta Platforms has been at the forefront of AI with its Llama large language model (LLM) Meta platforms are using AI to keep users more engaged on its social media apps .  Palantir Technologies has taken a different approach to AI, essentially looking to become the orchestration layer, or operating system, for the technology . It does this by gathering data from a wide array of sources and structuring it into an ontology that connects digital assets with their real-world counterparts . This then allows its customers to use its platform to solve complex problems through the use of AI .  Salesforce is now looking to become the leader in agentic AI, where AI agents will go out and perform tasks with little to no human interaction . As a consumption-based solution, AI agents are a huge opportunity for the company .  The Motley Fool is issuing “Double Down’s alerts for three incredible companies . Nvidia:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009,you’d have $373,066! Nvidia: If you invested in Apple in 2008, you'd have $38,158! Netflix:if . invested in Netflix in 2004, you would have $664,089! Right now, there may not be another chance like this anytime soon .

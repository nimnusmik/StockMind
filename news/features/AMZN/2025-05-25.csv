" President Trump has taken aim at at least four retailers over possible tariff price hikes . ""I'll be watching,"" he told Walmart, Amazon, Ford, and Mattel . Threats of additional tariffs in response to price increases have already been offered with an array of additional tools at the president's disposal .  Many of these tools were considered and even employed during Joe Biden's presidency as part of the then-Democratic charges of ""price gouging"" during inflation . Richard Nixon-issued executive order in 1971 that imposed a 90-day freeze on wages and prices during that inflation crisis .  ""I do worry that we're on the conveyor belt towards that type of policy,"" he said of price controls . Trump has not suggested that price controls are in the offing .  President Trump has seen some results from his public pressure campaign . One recent success for the White House came when Home Depot publicly pledged in multiple interviews not to raise prices . Other companies may have little choice but to risk Trump's ire given thin profit margins in retail .  The White House has said it's foreign companies that will absorb tariffs . But few economists agree with the White House's position that foreign companies will absorb the tariffs . The Cato Institute's Bourne said increasing pressure on prices could fuel a bipartisan narrative that ""greedflation"" is a problem .  Bourne: ""I fundamentally think this is just about trying to jawbone companies. for consumers"" Bourne says the White House is trying to ""jawbone companies"" for consumers .",neutral,"tariffs, tariff, retailers, prices, inflation"
" Walmart has rewarded investors with outsized gains . The retail giant is delivering value for consumers in-store and online . Inflation and economic uncertainty have pressured consumers to be more cost-conscious . Even with Walmart’s advantages, the path forward will be challenging .  Walmart's global e-commerce sales grew by 22% in the recent quarter (first quarter fiscal 2026), far outpacing its total constant currency revenue growth of 4%. In the U.S., Walmart grew comparable sales by 4.5%, or 450 basis points . Walmart isn't firing on all cylinders, but that it is doing what it can amid a challenging operating environment .  Walmart is in the sweet spot because it can compete with Amazon on price . The number of U.S. deliveries in less than three hours grew by 91% in just one year . Walmart is also managing costs to drive profitability in e-commerce . Amazon Fresh and Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market simply can't compete with Walmart .  Much of Walmart's recent rally is justified because the company has made measurable improvements to diversify its business . Walmart said that e-commerce, Walmart Marketplace (an online platform for third-party sellers), advertising, and membership (such as Sam's Club and Walmart+) give it room to absorb costs and should help it grow profits faster than sales .  Walmart is an excellent example of a well-run business that may not be the best stock to buy now . Walmart has leaned into its value-focused roots to take market share from other outlets and grow e-commerce to offset slower in-store growth . However, the valuation is overextended, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 41.2 and a forward P/E ratio of 36.9 .  Walmart is priced like a growth stock even though the overall business isn't growing at growth stock levels . Investors are better off buying a value stock with a higher yield for passive income .

" Options contain inherent leverage that make them riskier than owning individual stocks and ETFs . As traders, it’s our job to identify those risks and put the odds back in our favor . Many options traders fail because they attempt to predict the future .  Discount brokers have been competing forcefully with one another, and all this competition has driven down rates . Individuals can now trade stocks for free in most cases, and options contracts cost just pennies on the dollar .  Options are generally not as liquid as stocks, and therefore the market maker attempts to realize a profit from the bid/ask spread . This spread is typically much wider for options as opposed to stocks . This makes it more difficult to trade options, particularly those with low volumes .  The AMZN July 18 160-strike call has a bid quote of 44.3 points and an ask price 44.9 points . As options cover 100 shares of the underlying security, the current asking price for interested buyers is $4,490 per contract . If you were to use a market order to purchase this call option, we’d expect to be filled at the ask price . Finding a market maker that is able to buy or sell at a more favorable price can result in significant cost savings .  Amazon appears to be resuming its longer-term uptrend, making it a good candidate for a call option purchase . Purchasing this option gives us the right to buy 100 shares of Amazon stock at $160 on or before the expiration date . Amazon is currently trading at $202.85/share .  The top (blue) row shows the performance of AMZN stock based on different percentage scenarios at expiration . The bottom (purple) row . shows the corresponding percentage return for our call option trade . A 15% increase in the stock price would yield a $3,042 profit . The illustration shows the inherent leverage that options provide .  The 1.75 points worth of time value (red box) equate to just 0.9% of the Amazon stock price . A good way to manage risk when buying call options is to minimize time value and maximize intrinsic value . Time value decays rapidly in the days leading up to option expiration .",negative,"options, market, option, bid, cost"

If a fund has over $100 million in assets, it is required to divulge its end-of-quarter holdings to the SEC .  During the first quarter, Tiger Global Management purchased a few big-time AI stocks . These included Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing . All four of these stocks were already in the fund's portfolio prior to Q1 .

While Microsoft has proven to be a strong and resilient business over the past few years, I don't think I'd want to own the stock as much as the other three .

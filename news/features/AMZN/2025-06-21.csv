" Motley Fool analysts David Meier and Jason Moser join host Ricky Mulvey to discuss: Earnings from CrowdStrike,Lululemon, andBroadcom . Stacey Vanek Smith, co-host ofEverybody's Business, joins Ricky for a look at the tough job market facing college grads .  Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies . Nvidia:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009,you’d have $377,293!* Apple: If you invested . $37,319!* Netflix: $659,171!  The unemployment rate stands at 4.2%, while jobs were added above estimates . The US added almost 100,000 fewer jobs than estimates thought in the prior two months . Jason Moser: ""We're not close to teetering into a recession it would appear""  Ricky Mulvey: It's going to be interesting to see how the Fed reacts to this in the back half of the year . The odds of a recession this year are at 27%, something that remains surprising to me, since we are coming off a quarter of economic contraction .  This is a very confusing economic time for any observer . We'll dive into some jobs trends, tariffs, the economy with Bloomberg's Stacey Vanek Smith later in the show . We're going to focus on the business .  CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz is excited about the necessity agentic AI is creating for CrowdStrike holding Inc's AI native security . AI agents by customers of CrowdStrike, they actually create threat vectors for bad actors, David Meier says .  CrowdStrike has authorized one billion dollars for share buybacks . This is also a company that likes to issue a lot of stock, and it makes sense . David Meier: Cybersecurity is the only business that gets worse every single year in technology .  CrowdStrike more than doubled since outage, but there has to be plenty of things for CrowdStrike to be investing in going forward . Ricky Mulvey: For those listening, you have a few options when you have that extra cash, you can keep that cash on the balance sheet or what's wrong with a special dividend?  Lululemon is exposed to this tariff environment like most others in its space . 35% of fabrics originated from Taiwan, 28% from China mainland, and 11% from South Korea . The raw materials that they use, things like content labels, elastics, buttons, clasps, draw cords, all originates from Asia Pacific .  Lululemon has gotten absolutely crushed. It's at basically a grocery store earnings multiple, which, to me, says, no growth is ever coming again for this company . China revenue is up 22% versus the Americas up only 2% .  At around 18 times full-year earnings estimates, that's low, historically speaking . However, it also is because essentially it's pricing and no earnings growth this year . David Meier: If you think the company can return back to modest top-line growth and really bringing it down to the bottom line for more robust earnings growth, then today would make a lot of sense as a potential buying opportunity .  After the break, it's the rumble between President Trump, Elon Musk, in the impact on Tesla . Ricky Mulvey: What we've learned this week is that some friendships don't last forever . If you want the receipts of their beef, check out X and Truth Social .  The bill essentially eliminates a credit worth as much as $7,500 for buyers of certain Tesla models and other EVs by the end of the year . That would translate to roughly 1.2 billion dollar hit to Tesla's full year profit .  Tesla is in a very weird spot right now . Ricky Mulvey: Once you start accusing the president of being on certain lists and threatening to release those lists, I would guess that he is not going to take your calls anymore .  David Meier: Tesla has managed to upset people on both sides . He says it's a trend of brands getting hurt for the long term when they get political . Meier: ""Yes, but only if Musk stops focusing [LAUGHTER] on the soap opera""  Broadcom's revenue rose 20% on the year here . This is an AI fueled growth story that I think not a ton of people are talking about . The demand for AI chips remains high and is growing fast .  Broadcom's chips, we talk about Invidia and the GPUs that allow these, like, AI LLMs to run, are more of a connective tissue . They're working in the background doing memory and networking for running these AI workloads . Their customers include the big tech companies we talked about more often on the show .  David Meier: This is a bit of a good news, bad news quarter . But why is the stock down? It really is about the Billings and the subsequent guidance for the coming quarter .  Jason Moser: Billings that's ultimately a timing issue, so it can be difficult to predict . David Meier: I understand the billings concerns, but there was also a lot to like in the report . Total customers up 10%, surpassing 1.7 million in large customers .  Ricky Mulvey: The economy is in an interesting spot . The labor market looks hot on the surface, but it's a different story for college grads . Stacey Vanek Smith co hosts the podcast Everybody's Business from Bloomberg Business .  The U-6 rate, which includes marginally attached workers, is the biggest, broadest understanding of the labor market . Stacey Vanek Smith: This sounds like a labor market that is firing all cylinders, but there seems to be a lot of issues and problems under the surface .  Job market is something that you feel and affects our day to day lives . Unemployment numbers are the most easy to talk about of all economic indicators . But all signs would point to a bad job market, he says .  Stacey Vanek Smith: Job openings are up. Hiring went up more than expected. I don't know, Ricky Mulvey: I have some thoughts, but it's is such a disconnect. The Jolts report is an interesting one. That's one that I've called before the take your job and stuff it index .  Everyone I talked to felt pretty bad about the job market, except for one woman who was in engineering, who said she felt like everyone she knew had a job . Ricky Mulvey: Can you make any sense of that disconnect?  Fed Chief Stacey Vanek Smith says jobs are a lagging indicator because companies will often wait a little bit to lay people off if times get tough . Smith: Companies might be more hesitant than they would have been before to let people go, just knowing it can be hard to find good people .  It could just be the sectors that are hiring might be less visible than the other ones . Ricky Mulvey: ""I have trouble believing that, but I don't know. I'm looking at the numbers. It doesn't make any sense to me""  There is a tremendous amount of bias in that sample, Ricky Mulvey says . Stacey Vanek Smith: We're also journalists, and media is a hot mess right now. We might have a skewed view because the people we know and our colleagues, it's a difficult moment for media. That part would be my guess, with the slowdown in white collar work, the only way that that makes sense is if there is some makeup in what you said as healthcare work .  Stacey Vanek Smith: Some companies are creating long-term problems for themselves by getting rid of entry level positions . Smith: That could account for why it's such a hard moment for recent grads in computer science to get jobs .  A lot of entry level coding jobs are being done by AI, says Ricky Mulvey . Mulvey: The other biggest economic story is tariffs . He says a lot of the jobs that would have gone to people starting out are getting snapped up by AI .  Stacey Vanek Smith: Tariffs, I'm so interested in this, and simultaneously also, so a little bit scared of it . Smith: Usually trade deals, these are slow creaking wheels in the economy, and then they're in place forever .  American consumer spending is two-thirds of the US economy, but it's also almost 20% of the global economy . Trump likes having that muscle to flex, but also the entire world's economy has accommodated itself around us buying tons of stuff . If that actually changes or even changes a little, I think the ripples from that are going to be immense .  Ricky Mulvey: Right now, the economy is pretty much in the soft landing that the Fed wanted a while ago . Stacey Vanek Smith: I would have thought that through Liberation Day, through these tariff policies, you would see prices rise immediately . I always think about Argentina because of the protectionist tariffs in place in 2010 .  Stacey Vanek Smith: This was a big shock to me too. This was another layer of vibe session because when the inflation report was coming out, the consumer price index, the CPI, this last one, I was like, here we go, because the tariffs have now been in place for a few months . Even though there's been a lot of back and forth, businesses have been padding their prices .  Ricky Mulvey: ""It's like the Through the Looking-Glass economy. It is like the Lewis Carroll economy. Nothing seems to match up with what I think"" Stacey Vanek Smith: ""We are in a more volatile market. I just don't know anymore""  Stacey Vanek Smith: The bond market does seem to be flashing red, especially with the big beautiful bill, the tax cut extension going through Congress, which could potentially add $4 trillion to the deficit . She says she's watching the bond market, along with the markets and the job's numbers .  Ricky Mulvey: This is Rick Engdahl's final radio show . He is a folk artist who somehow ended up at the Fool . Up next, Radar Stocks, stay right here .  Amazon's reportedly close to beginning testing human-like autonomous delivery methods, or in simpler terms, robots that deliver packages to your door . This is certainly quite futuristic and likely a ways away from becoming reality, but they're starting to test this stuff out .

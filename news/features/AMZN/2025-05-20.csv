" President Trump urges Walmart not to raise prices because of tariffs on Chinese imports . Shares of the retail giant fell around 2% in premarket trading on Monday . Walmart's stock has been one of the market's top performers of the past year .  Walmart CFO John David Raineysaid on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts last week: ""Low prices is what we stand for, and we're going to keep prices as low as we can"" The US tariff rate on China currently sits at 30%, down from 145% at the height of the trade tussle .  First quarter sales rose 2.5% from the prior year to $165.6 billion, falling shy of Wall Street estimates for $166.02 billion .

US same-store sales also beat expectations with a 4.5% increase, led by health and wellness, and groceries . But transaction growth at its Walmart US stores weakened in the quarter, compared with trends last year . Full-year earnings per share outlook was mostly below analyst estimates of $2.61 .

" Large-cap tech stocks have been the market's core growth drivers since the turn of the century . Amazon is one of the few exceptions, which is surprising given the company's leading positions in cloud computing, robotics, and quantum computing . Despite robust business fundamentals, the stock has underperformed in 2025, falling 6.3% .  In Q1 2025, AWS posted revenue of $29.3 billion, up 17% year over year . AWS holds roughly 30% of the global cloud infrastructure market . CEO Andy Jassy recently noted that AI-related workloads on AWS are growing at triple-digit rates .  Around 75% of Amazon customer orders involve some form of robotic assistance . The latest robotic fulfillment centers process orders roughly 25% faster and cut the cost to serve by about 25% . Analysts estimate that warehouse automation could yield $10 billion in annual cost savings by 2030 .  Amazon embedding quantum tools directly into its cloud infrastructure . Amazon's early investment and infrastructure advantage could make it the dominant provider once the field crosses into commercial viability .

" When looking for stocks less exposed to tariffs, investors might be surprised to find Amazon . Amazon's retailing segments earn most of their operating income from outside of retailing . AWS, an AI-driven services business, drives the majority of its operating income . A favorable valuation could serve as an incentive to buy Amazon stock .  Amazon only publishes operating income numbers for its e-commerce-oriented North America and international segments . That doesn't make Amazon tariff-proof . Subscription, third-party seller services, and digital advertising are Amazon's largest revenue source .  The Trump administration announced ""Liberation Day"" on April 2, right after the company's first quarter ended . Even though some tariff announcements occurred in Q1, the levies likely did not have a material impact . Amazon Web Services is a service-based business, meaning it probably sidesteps the effects of tariffs completely .  Amazon's public image is mainly tied to retailing, its largest source of revenue . Retailing is more like a loss leader, bolstering faster-growing enterprises with less tariff exposure . Amazon's P/E ratio is slightly higher than the S&P 500 average of 28 .  Amazon's comparatively low valuation is not a reason to turn away from Amazon stock . Tariffs have little effect on the most successful parts of Amazon's business . Amazon generated most of its operating income .  John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors .

The Goochland County site will be the fourth such facility in the state for the e-commerce giant .  Amazon is building a robotics fulfillment center in North Carolina . The company has around 100 such sites across the U.S. Amazon is also testing new robotics technology that will eventually be deployed across the globe .  Walmart slashed unit costs by 20% year over year at its next-generation automated fulfillment centers compared to manual sites . Rival Walmart has also touted the benefits of increased automation within its own network .",neutral,"walmart, amazon, robotics, facility, fulfillment"
" Warren Buffett announced that he would step down as Berkshire Hathaway's CEO at the end of the year . Greg Abel has been with Berkshire for 25 years, but he isn't an acclaimed stock picker like Buffett . He probably won't stray too far from Buffett's playbook of investing in stable and cash-rich businesses .  Berkshire bought its first shares of Amazon in the first quarter of 2019 . It now holds 10 million shares with a market value of $2.05 billion . That represents 0.7% of Berkshire's entire portfolio . Investors can simply buy three of Buffett's older picks --Amazon, Kroger and Coca-Cola .  Amazon's retail business faces some near-term pressure from the tariffs . Analysts expect Amazon's revenue and earnings per share to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% and 17% . Berkshire started to invest in Kroger in the fourth quarter of 2019 and now owns 50 million shares worth nearly $3.4 billion .  Kroger's scale helped it resist inflation, recessions, and other macro headwinds . Analysts expect revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 2% and 13% respectively . Kroger is diversifying supply chains to mitigate the impact of the Trump administration's unpredictable tariffs .  Coca-Cola isn't heavily exposed to tariffs because it only sells concentrates and syrups . Analysts expect the company's revenue and EPS to increase at a steady CAGR from 2024 to 2027 .  Coca-Cola has raised its payout for 63 consecutive years . The company's stock looks reasonably valued at 25 times forward earnings, pays a high forward yield of 3%, and it's aDividend King .

" President Donald Trump says he will use his bully pulpit to publicly shame companies that dare to raise prices because of tariffs . Walmart last week said it would have tojack up some pricesbecause of high costs of the global trade war . Trump on Saturday responded forcefully, demanding Walmart reverse its decision .  Trump threatened a 100% tariff on Mattel after the company said it would have to raise prices . Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said Trump’s tariffs won’t bring toy manufacturing to America .  Trump tweeted that Walmart made “BILLIONS of DOLLARS last year, far more than expected” Walmart is America’s biggest retailer and had a strong year on the back of inflation-weary customers seeking out its notoriously low prices . No one believes Walmart, the world's largest company measured by revenue, is artificially high prices .  Trump is probably right that Walmart could “eat” much or all of the tariff cost and make out just fine . But CEO Doug McMillon doesn’t work for Trump — he works for Walmart’s shareholders . To keep its minuscule margins steady, the company would have to pass some of that on to customers .  Investors will be watching Home Depot and Target very closely this week for more signs of trade war pain and, perhaps, higher prices . Higher prices are coming to America, and no amount of bullying, even from the president, can stop it .",negative,"tariffs, tariff, walmart, retailer, prices"
" UPS transports millions of packages each business day across the globe . Amazon is UPS’s largest customer by far in terms of volume and revenue . Amazon deliveries are also some of the least profitable sides of the business, with tiny margins .  Year-to-date, UPS shares are down 19.7% while the S&P 500 Index is down only 3.4% . Geopolitical uncertainty, global trade concerns, and poor consumer sentiment continue to contribute to the economic slowdown and slowing demand for UPS in Asia and Europe .  UPS faces significant headwinds as it navigates a complex landscape marked by a significant shift in its Amazon relationship, persistent weakness in key international markets, and increasing labor costs .",negative,"ups, deliveries, amazon, slowdown, markets"
" Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market and robust software moat has made it a darling of the stock market . Amazon's AWS cloud computing platform, complete AI stack, and effective data-driven advertising platform are key growth catalysts . Both companies are trading at valuation levels significantly lower than their historical averages .  Semiconductor giant Nvidia has 92% share in the $125 billion data center GPU market . Nvidia's recently launched Blackwell architecture chips are already showing strong momentum . Blackwell systems are optimized for inferencing (real-time deployment) workloads .  Nvidia's stock price has been quite volatile in 2025, falling nearly 35% from its high in early January to its recent low in April . The surge in share price was driven by the company's strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia, which will provide several hundred thousand of its advanced GPUs over the next five years .  The U.S. government has revoked the Biden-era AI diffusion rule, which would have restricted chip exports to 120 countries, starting May 15, 2025 . Amazon Web Services (AWS) is indisputably a significant growth catalyst for Amazon .  Amazon's AI initiatives are also helping build new revenue streams . The company's AI business has already reached a ""multibillion dollar annual revenue run rate"" Amazon is focused on developing a complete AI stack, including custom chips, foundational models, and AI applications .  Amazon's retail operations are benefiting from a rearchitected inbound network, driving better inventory placement, higher units per package, and lower delivery costs . The company is also working on other initiatives, such as expanding its same-day delivery sites and rural delivery network .  Kuiper positions Amazon to capture a substantial share of the satellite internet market estimated to be worth $108 billion by 2035 . Despite its strong fundamentals and multiple tailwinds, Amazon trades at approximately 28.6 times forward earnings, which is well below the five-year average .

" S&P 500 Index clawing back into the green for 2025 after being whipsawed by President Donald Trump’s vacillating trade policies . Tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) are still down this year . Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index includes those companies as well as Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  Technology and telecommunications stocks both rose more than 35% to lead the S&P 500’s 23% gain last year . This year, typically lagging groups like industrials, utilities and financials are driving the stock market . Whether Big Tech can re-establish its historical dominance in 2025 is the existential question facing investors .  Hedge funds on Tuesday snapped up US equities at the fastest pace since April 9 . Technology stocks were the biggest beneficiaries of the buying . Betting on Big Tech a decade ago resulted in a gain of 2,179%, compared with 181% for the S&P 500 .  The Magnificent Seven accounts for about a third of the benchmark’s market capitalization . The mega-tech index is down 4.2% for the year compared with a 1.3% rise in the S&P 500 . “I think all-time highs are possible,” Gardner says .  Since the S&P 500 bottomed on April, tech stocks have led the way higher, with the sector rising 31% compared with a 20% gain for the entire index . Betting on a tech rally comes with its own risks .

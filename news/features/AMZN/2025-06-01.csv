" The stock market's crazy first five months of 2025 have left Wall Street pros in a pickle . The benchmark is basically flat for 2025 and putting up one of its worst starts to a year since the 1950s . It's also getting handily beaten by stock markets around the world .  Over the past 30 years, the S&P’s average return is roughly flat for June, as much of Wall Street begins its summer holiday season . Corporate executives are as pessimistic as they’ve been since 2022, according to a recent CEO confidence survey .  The S&P 500’s 19% plunge from its Feb. 19 record pushed it into a correction in just 16 trading days and brought it to the brink of a bear market . But after its almost 19% rebound since then, equity valuations have gotten much more stretched . US stocks are trailing the MSCI All Country World Index excluding the US Index by 12 percentage points in 2025 .  Historically, the third year of a US bull market, like now, is the weakest . Since World War II, the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of just 5.2% in year three . Since 1947, bull markets have averaged 55 months .  The market’s best performing sector this year is industrials, an optimistic sign for shares and growth . Defensive plays like utilities and consumer staples companies are also atop the leader board . Consumer discretionary shares that house some of the biggest retailers, homebuilders and automakers are among the worst performers this year .  In post-US presidential election years over the past seven decades, the S&P 500 has struggled in early June as investors booked profits heading into the summer . This is particularly true if the index gets a strong boost in May, like it did this year with a 6.2% jump .",negative,"markets, stocks, 2025, stock, market"

Coffee shop operator Dutch Bros has one of the best growth stories in the consumer space . It operates small locations that are mainly served by drive-thrus, giving it strong unit economics and quick payback periods . The company also has a huge opportunity to grow its same-store sales through the introduction of food items .  Food makes up less than 2% of Dutch Bros sales, while food made up 19% of Starbucks' sales last quarter . Philip Morris International has an advantage of not selling cigarettes in the U.S., which has been a declining market due to health concerns and the popularity of vaping .  Philip Morris is up nearly 50% this year and trades at a reasonable valuation . It doesn't manufacture or sell cigarettes in the U.S., so it has no worries on that front .

" Netflix outperformed Q1 2025 earnings estimates with a 25% surge in earnings per share and near-record levels of operating margins . But under the hood, its free cash flow paints a different picture . A large part of the beat was facilitated by content amortization timing and delayed spending, not cash-driven profit . New shift into advertising, live programming, and gaming could hold long-term potential .  Revenue growth at UCAN slowed to 9% YoY from 15% in Q4 . APAC increased by 23%, and LATAM by 8%, but these markets have a correspondingly lower ARPU that constrains contribution to operating income . Content liabilities stand at $21.8 billion, with amortization spiking . Netflix is pre-paying spend into live sports, global content, and unscripted programming .  Advertising still contributes a ""very small"" percentage to income today . The firm has maintained a cautious investment so far, framing it more in the form of optionality than a near-term lever . Gaming is still the most speculative area, with minimal monetization and uncertain market fit .  Netflix is expanding where the margins are thinnest . Netflix's moat, previously framed by scale and ubiquity, is eroding . Netflix does not have a second business layer (such as Amazon's retail or Disney's parks) Netflix's valuation today extends far past industry norms and history to market medians .  Netflix is valued like a capital-expensive media platform instead of a high-margin SaaS business . P/E of 47.17, each of which is in the top decile of the industry . PEG of 3.57 and price-to-free cash flow of 70.67 reflect how far-stretched the stock is from its fundamentals .  Netflix is no longer the sole bidder for the attention economy . It competes with YouTube for short-form and creator-driven content, TikTok for younger audiences, as well as with Apple and Amazon for bundle benefits .  Netflix doesn't have adjacent business ecosystems, so it is more vulnerable to a shift in content ROIC . The firm is further confronted by mounting political headwinds . With its viewership spread across more than two-thirds of its customers outside of the U.S., Netflix must now contend with international regulation .  Investors would do well to watch out for monetization conversion from ads as well as live content, margin control through H2 2025 . Market is already paying for it all .",negative,"netflix, viewership, income, revenue, investment"

" Apple’s once-glorified assistant has fallen way behind flashier AI like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude . After years of stunted updates and stiff competition from Google, OpenAI, and Amazon, Siri is potentially on the brink of a reinvention . Whispers suggest this gamble could pay off and finally turn Apple stock's fortunes around .  Siri was created by Apple in 2011 and has been missing in action since then . ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok have evolved into sharp, context-savvy bots . Apple tried to turn things around with its massive ‘Apple Intelligence” rebrand in mid-2024, backed by savvy on-device models .  Recent reports suggest that Siri’s brain power could potentially be outsourced, marking a major U-turn for a company that has looked to build everything in-house . Apple shares popped 2% on the news, with Apple stock in the green . The shake-up follows big leadership moves, too .  The company has reportedly asked OpenAI and Anthropic to train AI models that can run on Apple’s cloud servers . That essentially means a much faster rollout and fewer AI hiccups . Samsung used Google's Gemini for its smartphones and Amazon's Alexa tapped Anthropic's Claude . Apple's already shelling out billions to run its own models in the cloud starting next year .  The stock market is down more than 17% year to date, and close to 18% in the past six months alone . It’s down 17% this year, and 18% since the start of the year .

President Trump’s recent executive orders on nuclear power outline a sweeping agenda to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050 .

Building nuclear power plants is notoriously expensive and time-consuming . SMRs are typically manufactured in factories and can reduce construction time and costs . Nuclear fusion is often called the ""holy grail"" of energy because it promises a virtually limitless, clean, and safe source of power by replicating the process that fuels the stars .

Earlier this year, I noted that Meta looks like the best AI play among the group . In this article, we’ll analyze whether the Mark Zuckerberg-led company still earns that title .

Last month, Meta acquired a 49% stake in Scale AI, hiring its founder, Alexandr Wang, along with other key employees in the process .

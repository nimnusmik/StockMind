Berkshire owns a large portfolio of quality stocks that can help you grow your savings . Splitting your money between the following stocks would lay a promising foundation for long-term growth .  Buffett brought in Todd Combs and Ted Weschler several years ago to oversee a small portion of Berkshire's investments . One of their top picks is none other than e-commerce and cloud services leader Amazon . The stock has more than doubled since Berkshire first boughtshares of Amazon in 2019's first quarter .  Amazon earned $66 billion in net income on $650 billion of revenue in the past year . Analysts expect Amazon's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 19% in the coming years . Buffett has pledged not to sell a single share of his Berkshire Hathaway stock .  Abel took over as CEO of MidAmerican in 2008, which Berkshire acquired in 1999 . Abel will be charged with overseeing a large portfolio of operating businesses, spanning retail, the BNSF railroad, manufacturing, and insurance businesses .

" PillPack founders TJ Parker and Elliot Cohen are building an online storefront for medical care that they believe can become the one-stop shop that doesn't currently exist . Today, the startup and online shop, called General Medicine, is launching publicly, backed by Amazon .

New patients upload their insurance information if they have it and take a short survey about the issue they are experiencing, which creates a customized intake form .  General Medicine's own doctors are in-network with many large providers including United Healthcare, Blue Cross and United Healthcare . Patients can message or conduct a video chat with General Medicine’s in-house doctors . Pricing is transparent for cash-paying or insurance-covered patients .  General Medicine makes money like a regular doctor’s office might if a customer conducts a telehealth visit with telehealth .

The company could also potentially partner with big consumer AI companies to help customers book or find medical care after they research information through a chatbot .

" Stord, the logistics tech startup founded by former Thiel fellowSean Henry, is stepping up its campaign to challenge Amazon's grip one-commerce . The deal,announced Monday, brings an additional 2.5 million square feet of fulfillment space into Stord's network .  Stord aims to ""level the playing field"" for independent e-commerce brands that struggle to match Amazon's fulfillment speed . The core problem facing small and mid-size merchants is the lack of scale . Stord is backed by high-profile investors, including Kleiner Perkins, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, Franklin Templeton and Strike Capital .  Stord is positioning itself as a full-cycle logistics alternative for merchants who want to retain brand control without sacrificing speed or reach . Henry told CNBC that disruption has historically driven merchants toward platforms like Stord that offer adaptability at scale .  Stord focuses on more than warehousing, developing proprietary software designed to work in lockstep with its physical operations . Henry: “If we are the one who's building our own technology in harmony with our operations... it's gonna be really hard for others to keep up.”  Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target –Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.30/share!",neutral,"stord, logistics, warehousing, merchants, commerce"

" Nike Inc. has reported year-over-year sales declines for four consecutive quarters . Nike announced a two-pronged strategy on May 22: resuming direct sales through Amazon and implementing targeted price increases to enhance profit margins . I maintain a bearish outlook on Nike’s stock, as I believe the current valuation does not fully reflect the key risks the company continues to face .  Nike’s return to Amazon is likely to be completed before the end of this month . Amazon has notified third-party sellers that they will not be allowed to sell certain Nike products, starting on July 19 . Selling directly on Amazon also allows Nike greater control over its brand presentation .  As part of its strategy to reignite growth, Nike plans to implement selective price increases across certain product categories . Nike will exempt several key categories from these hikes, including Air Force 1 . Investors should be mindful of potential risks associated with this strategy .  Nike's gross margins have faced downward pressure in recent years, falling to 41.5% in Q3 FY2025 from 46% in FY2022 . The degree to which these hikes will bolster gross margins depends largely on the company’s ability to maintain stable sales volumes and the overall impact of the tariffs .  NKE stock carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 14 Buy, 15 Hold, and zero Sell ratings . The average stock price target of $76.75implies approximately 28% upside potential over the next 12 months .  Stanley analyst Alexandra Stratonhighlighted that direct sales on Amazon represent a clear positive, potentially adding $300 million to $500 million in incremental annual revenue . While Nike’s return to Amazon is a positive development, I remain cautious on the stock due to its elevated valuation .  Nike's price increases may not translate into margin expansion, as the company faces rising import tariffs alongside the risk of reduced sales volumes . Given its current elevated valuation, Nike offers a limited margin of safety for investors .",negative,"nike, stock, sales, profit, sellers"

" Motley Fool analyst Jim Gillies and host Ricky Mulvey discuss Nike's return toAmazon.com . The fundamentals and risks of investing in turnaround stories. A fitness company with a potentially brighter future. PubMatic CEO Rajeev Goel about trends in digital advertising and his company's future.  Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, available when you joinStock Advisor, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon . Apple:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008,you’d have $37,070!* Netflix: If you invested . $1k on Netflix in 2004, you'd have $639,271!  Nike is back to selling its products on Amazon . This is five years after pulling its products from the e-commerce giant . Jim Gillies: It's nice that Nike does the right thing after trying all the other alternatives . Gillies asks: Why would anyone want to sell inCostco, or through Walmart?  Foot Locker is an iconic brand with products and athletes that people identify with . It's been, I think, three and a half years since it topped out. This is a company that maxed out. It's an iconic company .  Nike is also in a tough environment to turn around, announcing that it's going to hike prices on June 1 . Ricky Mulvey: Turnarounds take a while. Nike's shed almost two thirds of its value over the past four years .  President Trump jawboned them down last weekend . The second they say, ""Our costs are higher, so we're going to have to pass a law on the costs caused by tariffs"" Ricky Mulvey: It's going to be interesting times for Nike in this new higher cost environment .  Nike has the Win Now plan, which is focusing on retail partners as we mentioned . Ricky Mulvey: It is difficult for companies to turn around. incredibly difficult. I don't want to discount Nike's ability, but there's also a pricing game that's going to be tough for them.  Turnarounds are difficult, and a lot of time turnaround doesn't last long . We have seen this story before, and the principles that I have when looking at any turnaround, first of all, are difficult . I have very fond memories .  The company turns around on the person who's trying to drive the turnaround . The second thing is, it's probably going to take you a long time and longer than you expect . Don't even throw any money at it or throw 0.1% tiny starter position .  One of the turnarounds that actually turned that I can appreciate is Chipotle . Ricky Mulvey: Chipotle in 2015, a very bad, terrible, awful year . Jim Gillies: It's nice that they went for the defense industry as well as the airline . Ricky: If you rushed in in the first year, boy, you've been waiting a long time for your money .  By the time you come along in 2016, the stock had already been knocked down by about 40 or 50% . In mid-2016, it's like, ""Evaluation is much better. They've at least paid lip service to improving the quality."" Ironically, a lot of it was tied to their whole food with integrity thing .  Chipotle was still dead money for another two and a half, almost three years . It was only after Founder Steve Ells is gone, and they bring in Brian Niccol from Taco Bell . Only then did Chipotle have its renaissance, Ricky Mulvey says .  Are there any current turnaround stories that you're more interested in than Nike? Gillies: I have no prediction, but you're not biting on Nike. would bet that in 10 years from now, 20 years later, people are still buying Nike shoes, not that I agree that is. These things are difficult. If you had told me that I would be an owner of Pelotontoday, I'm not sure I would .  Peloton spent the COVID bubble completely overbuilding and pushing as far away as possible . They overbuilt all of their fitness gear, which is very low margin, as opposed to their subscription business . The people who were intent on empire building are gone .  Peloton was down 99% at one point, but has beaten and raised its guidance each time . The company generated at least 75 million in free cash flow in the last three quarters .  After three quarters, Peloton has done 211 million in free cash flow, not what people were expecting from the corps of Peloton . After two quarters, again, bumped guidance up, and cash flow became at least 200 million for the year . Have 1.5 billion in debt, and some of it's very expensive debt, but they're going to pay it off fairly quickly .  Ricky Mulvey: ""I think Peloton not only can be a multi-bagger from here or here being six dollars when I was looking at it fairly recently. I think you could see a world in less than five years where Peloton goes from six 25 to 30. I'm more interested in that kind of a turnaround, where the bombing happened, and it's just rubble everywhere, rather than at a Boeing, at a Nike, at an Intel .  Motley Fool Chief Investment Officer Andy Cross and senior analyst Asit Sharma interviewed the CEO of PubMatic Rajeev Goel . They talk about ad buyers shift to streaming and what investors need to know about this ad seller's future revenue growth .  Instacartdata, for instance, is available on our platform . If a marketer wants to target people that are shopping for specific products, or maybe it's a conquest where you say, ""If they boughtCampbell'ssoup, then we want to show them an ad for the alternative"" Rajeev Goel: The advertising market is not just growing, but as you mentioned, really evolving toward more programmatic spend .  Asit Sharma: More and more, this targeting is moving to the sale side of the ecosystem rather than the buy side . We can extend the value of that data. outside of Instacart itself. We can bring all of these pieces together to enable a customer to vary efficiently with a high degree of performance .  In your last earnings call, you mentioned a shift in marketing funnels from top of the funnel activities to lower level activities . Rajeev Goel: There's no doubt that there's a degree of uncertainty out there, US trade policy, tariffs, all that kind of stuff that is causing some unease . The good news is that advertising always comes back bigger and better, and in particular, digital .  Advertising has been around for hundreds of years, and it's not going away . What typically happens is the underlying shifts that were happening slowly in the ecosystem, those get accelerated . I think we're going to see a more pronounced shift of dollars from linear TV into streaming .  Spot tends to be much more heavily programmatic dominated, and so we think that's a big upside potential for us . CFO is now getting into the CMOs here and saying, ""Hey, we got to make sure every dollar of ad spend is super accountable""  A lot of advanced data like people logged in. closed-loop reporting, the ability to measure what kind of sales happened . I think we're going, in a good position, to be able to manage through that shift for publishers to drive more performance ad spend . The third is more supply path optimization.  Asit Sharma: Usually, what happens in a macrocycle is people are much more willing to try new solutions . I think we're going to see an acceleration of interest and trial, a lot of these new AI solutions .  Rajeev Goel: I'm happy to share what I can in terms of forward-looking projections . Let me give a little bit of context on the business just from the last couple of quarters . In May of 2024, so almost exactly exactly a year ago, one of our large DSP buyers made a technical change to how they bid . That was a significant headwind for us. The same time, we saw a nice tailwind in political ad spend .  In the second half of last year, that underlying business grew 17% on a year-over-year basis, pretty good . That growth accelerated in Q1 to 21%, so we're seeing a really nice trajectory in the business . We are really targeting to grow at over 15% per year on a sustained basis .  John Mackey: ""I think that 15 ish percent is a good number. 15% plus rate. I think there will be quarters where we're above that"" Mackey says the market is growing in the 8-10 percent range .

" In this podcast, Motley Fool analyst Asit Sharma joins host Mary Long to discuss the complex problems that quantum computers could solve . In the show, Sharma discusses the healthcare and logistics companies benefit from ultra-fast processing .  The Motley Fool senior analyst Asit Sharma and Mary Long discuss quantum computing . They discuss the potential of quantum computing, what investors need to know about this technology . Quantum's future may come sooner than you think, they say .  Asit Sharma, a resident quantum industry expert, joins us to talk about quantum computing . Sharma: The promise of quantum computing is to solve intensely complex, large scale problems with a lot of variables .  While it sounds like it's all powerful, quantum computing isn't going to be applied to simple problems to solve them faster . Think really difficult things like predicting the weather . Classical computers have a lot of trouble with solving things linearly one step at a time .  Everything running through a computer, including AI computation is based on this very discrete binary system of zeros and ones added together . Quantum computing is a little different in that it takes a concept from quantum mechanics, which is one of the mysteries that underlines our physical existence .  If a particle can exist as one discrete thing, but also a wave function at the same time, it means that we can trap that particle and have it sit in a state of what's called superposition . A state of superposition means that that particle will encompass all the possibilities or probabilities of being a zero or a one . Quantum computing is a way to look at something that could be any number of possibilities, and the idea of a quantum computer is to direct the way that wave function collapses .  Asit Sharma: Generative AI is very suited to looking for patterns in sequential pieces of data . But you can only do so much with that. sort of show us the results we want that will be more probabilistically aligned with what we want to see .  Classical computing can only do so much when you're trying to figure out this one problem . But a quantum computer could really scale up and look at all the possibilities . We can get a better understanding of this binding from molecule to protein .  Asit Sharma: There are different industries that can benefit from quantum computing technology . One, surprisingly, is surprisingly, the delivery of goods, he says . Sharma: When you think about practical goods that could come from such technology, what are those goods?  Quantum computing may be very good at in the future is quickly solving some of this stuff . The idea of trying to understand risk across many, many companies or even within a single company .  Asit Sharma: We have some fledgling quantum computers that have been built and are functional . They are mostly being used by research institutions, but we're starting to see Fortune 500 companies utilize these computers in very basic types of experimental computations .  A lot of energy is going into solving for the errors in quantum computations . We have to keep those in a state that remains in superposition, meaning that it's got that state of lots of probabilities if we're trapping one ion and asking it to do it to solve the problems .  We don't want it to interact with the environment. perform computations. That can make that function collapse more quickly, and we won't get the desired results . Right now things are still at an experimental state, but we have reached a stage where companies are solving some smaller real world problems .  Asit Sharma: There's a lot to unpack with what Jensen Wong said, Mary. We're using less energy to actually make these computers operate. Decoherence? Is the usefulness of these quantum computers that Jensen's predicting? Is it that they're more useful because they can solve more difficult problems?  Jensen Huang said he didn't realize there were publicly traded companies that were building quantum computers . He invited some of the CEOs of the companies that have built quantum computers onto the stage to explain to the audience why he was wrong to say that . But he's right in that the timescale is not going to be 2026 .  quantum computer is going to be able to perform a task better than the best alternative we have that exists in a classical computer for a useful problem . When that occurs, many people will say we've reached a point where we have an inflection or a tipping point, maybe like a ChatGPT moment .  The primary computational unit in quantum computing is called a qubit . This is where you are using one particle and you are performing operations on that particle to get that probabilistic result . We have to be able to have qubits scale up. Many qubits, which are already prone to errors, are able to solve problems and then communicate with each other .  Entanglement is cool, but we can use entanglement to do computation . We can influence through certain quantum algorithms . When we take one qubit and then add another and add another, we can scale that system up . We're going to see a lot of, I'm going to call them quantum bros in advance, talking about where you should be investing .  IBM, Microsoft, and Google are building their own quantum computers from the ground up . Asit Sharma: These companies are building out all the supporting technology that powers these systems .  Alphabet has a chip called Willow that reduces error rates . IBM has a processor called the Heron quantum processor . Microsoft got fascinated with a type of approach, which is very theoretical .  Microsoft had to prove existence of what had been a theoretical particle called the Moderna Fermion . But in doing so, their approach is more fault-tolerant than the other approaches . The coded information is very stable and so it's taking an approach which is based on design .  Asit Sharma: I admire Microsoft for its ambition and the investments of however 100 millions they made . Mary Long: Apart from those three big dogs that you just walked us through, is anybody else currently working on building out a full-stack quantum computer?  Quantinuum is actually a joint venture between a company, it's very small company out of the UK, which merged up in this joint venture with the giantHoneywell computing . The company also has really a host platform, as IBM does .  Amazon is taking a totally different approach than the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet, and IBM . Rather than building out this full-stack computer, they're providing quantum computing access through its Cloud platform . It's like AWS, but for quantum computing, Asit Sharma says .  Amazon is using its might and its Cloud platform to further the quantum computing industry along, says Mary Kay . Kay: If one of these smaller companies really takes off? Well, they're already on Amazon's platform, and that will help Amazon scale up its quantum business . That's the advantage, Kay says, but the disadvantage is that Amazon doesn't have to make its own quantum computers .  Amazon is hosting the actual cryogenic systems for some of these other companies . It's getting a first-hand view of what it takes to build these computers to operate them . Amazon is also developing some interesting add-ons to its ecosystem .  Amazon's Brackett system is one of seven companies that are working on quantum computing . IonQand Righetti Computing are both companies that develop quantum systems that can link up to the Cloud .  D-Wave quantum has its approach this annealing, it fits right into Baquet. Ion Q, as I mentioned before, trapping ions, it goes right up into Amazon Baquete. Rigetti computing, also has a more modular approach.  Asit Sharma: The chipmakers right now are mostly looking at how their applications will be able to accelerate the development of quantum computing . Mary Long: What about chipmakers and chip designers? How do they fit into this future quantum landscape?  Synopsis is acquiring a company called ANSIS, which specializes in physics simulations . The chip designers, the electronic design automation companies, I think, have a role to play in quantum computing . The next step is looking at how you can transmit information from one quantum system to another .  There's a lot of interesting work that's happening among the smaller players in the quantum industry and in the biotech space, but it's highly technical . A lot of those small upstarts aren't profitable, so it's hard to make a good judgment about their financial situation . In the healthcare industry, rather than investing in biotech, if that feels a little bit too crazy to touch, what you can do is go to the big dogs .  Asit Sharma: The downside is that some of these smaller players may scale more quickly than would think at a first glance . The benefit in my mind, of applying this biotech approach to the quantum industry and investing in it, that feels obvious .  Quantum computing is going to open up a Pandora's box in encryption standards, says Dr. Andrew Keen . Keen: Quantum computing will open up Pandora's Box in all of our encryption standards .  A company that's very small like Ion Q which is thinking of building these large quantum networks over distances in addition to its own computer, has potentially a solution for a secure network that a bank could use . There is some possibility that a few of these companies, just like the little biotechs that you alluded to, could blow up . Could there be binary outcomes where you put your money in and it's either boom or bust? Sure .  Jensen Wong had an idea that 15-30 years in the future, this thing could be big . It's fun if you could identify a company and you're able to hold it for 20 years . It might not hurt to buy some shares in a few forward-looking companies that are embracing quantum .

IonQ generated $43 million in revenue in the last year, but burned through more than $300 million .

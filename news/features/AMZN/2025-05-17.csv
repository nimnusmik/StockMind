" Amazon.com began rolling out the new Alexa+ generative artificial-intelligence-powered voice assistant . There is scant evidence it is in regular customers' hands . The new service was meant to be a triumph for Amazon after several delays in revamping Alexa .  Reuters searched dozens of news sites, YouTube, TikTok, X, BlueSky and Meta's Instagram and Facebook . Two who posted on Reddit claimed to have used the service, but did not provide hard evidence . Amazon does not require nondisclosure agreements in exchange for Alexa+ access .  Amazon's AI-assisted Alexa+ has struggled with speed in answering some questions or prompts, sources say . It also occasionally generates inaccurate or fabricated information, like other AI models, and is expensive to operate . Alexa+ is meant to revitalize the decade-old service and help Amazon compete with chatbots .  Alexa+ will be able to respond to multiple prompts in sequence and act as an “agent” on behalf of users . Amazon gave reviewers time to test out its new color Kindle device at an event in October before making it available to buy two weeks later .  Techsponential's Greengart said the February Alexa event could be seen as an early warning sign because attendees were not allowed to try the service themselves . By leaving a large gap between product launch and general availability, Amazon was failing to build anticipation for Alexa+.  The upgraded Alexa is designed to allow users to seek shopping advice such as vacation outfits and to receive aggregated news stories . Amazon pointed to an April TechRadar story that cited an anonymous Reddit post from a user claiming to have tested the service .",neutral,"alexa, chatbots, amazon, ai, kindle"
" President Trump set out a broad framework early last month, including double-digit tariffs on countries worldwide and a tariff on China that reached 145% . The concern was high tariff levels would weigh on the economy and even lead to a recession . But when Trump halted the plan for 90 days to allow for negotiations with countries, indexes rebounded .  Among the biggest gainers in the market were tech stocks . Tech companies rely heavily on manufacturing abroad . A satisfactory trade deal between the U.S. and China suggests any tariffs on electronics also would be manageable .  Amazon says it's already taken steps to manage the situation, including buying inventory early to lower prices . This means agreements with lower-than-expected tariffs represent good news for Amazon . Third-party sellers on Amazon may have different strategies -- some may pass costs on to customers .  Nvidia has become the name that's practically synonymous with AI chips . The company is the world's top seller of AI chips and has developed an entire ecosystem of related products and services . This has helped Nvidia generate double- and triple-digit quarterly revenue growth .  Nvidia has been taking action to control the level of risk presented by tariffs . The idea that tariffs in general may be much lower than originally expected is fantastic news for the company . Nvidia is positioned to benefit from this new tariff climate, making it a solid stock to own right now .  High tariff levels represented a risk for both Amazon and Nvidia -- and today, the worst-case scenario has disappeared, replaced by a situation that should be much more manageable . That makes both of these stocks a great buy at the moment, but considering valuation, Nvidia gets extra points .

" Trade war between the U.S. and China has, at least for now, de-escalated . Rolling back reciprocal tariffs on Chinese imports is tremendous for Amazon's e-commerce business .

" South America is in the midst of a technologically driven sociocultural revolution . Most of its somewhat fragmented economies are also well shielded from tariff-induced turbulence . This hidden gem is increasingly being discovered by American investors looking for more international diversification .  MercadoLibre is a Latin American e-commerce giant . It firmly leads its competitors within the region's biggest and best markets like Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina . The company is also a major payment middleman akin toPayPal, logistics service provider, and increasingly, an advertising platform .  Latin America is where North America was in the late 1990s and early 2000s . Analysts expect it to do similarly well this year and next year despite the economic lethargy expected for most of the region . The disparity makes much more sense once you dig deeper into where technology is changing the continent's sociocultural situation .

MercadoLibre is already reliably profitable, for the record . Amazon's persistent success was rooted in a sociocultural and technological revolution that mere economic headwinds wouldn't stop . Don't underestimate capitalism's ability to find ways of finding ways of growth .  Amazon did just fine amid the fallout of 2008's subprime mortgage meltdown, mostly because North American consumers loved the convenience of online shopping and low prices more than they felt the impact of economic headwinds .

" Once key players in a fast fashion boom, Shein and Temu are now seeing customers buy clothing elsewhere online . Heightenedtariffs on Chinaand changes to thede minimis provision have added complications to the strategy that made the brands attractive to budget conscious customers .  Since the tariff announcements, consumers’ shopping patterns have quickly shifted . Some companies experience short-lived surges, such as TikTok Shop and DHgate . Meanwhile, more established players Shein and Temu are left experiencing long-term shifts . Amazon has stood out as a key player that may stand to benefit from U.S. consumers changing where they shop .  Over the last six months, the women’s clothing category on Amazon grew more than 26% . Three out of the five top brands in the category are China-based third-party sellers . The e-commerce giant recently extended its annual Prime Day sales event fromtwo days to four .

" Alphabet’s valuation is sharply lower than that of its mega-cap, tech-focused peers . It has a diversified business but is still heavily dependent on Google Search . However, competition could actually benefit Alphabet in the long run .  The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is simply the price of a stock divided by earnings per share over the last 12 months . The P/E ratio has some major flaws . Smoothing out the ratio by comparing it to historical averages over a period of time can be effective ways to get a better reading on a company's profitability .  The S&P 500's forward P/E ratio is 21.8, which is higher than its historical average . However, it is lower than every Magnificent Seven stock except Alphabet . Alphabet is cheaper than the benchmark, despite being such a dominant, industry-leading company .  Alphabet makes the vast majority of its revenue from services like Google Search, YouTube, Google Network, subscriptions, devices, and platforms . Google Search brought in over $50 billion in revenue, which made up 65.6% of total services revenue . The sheer size of Google Search compared to YouTube illustrates the company's dependence on Google Search .  Google Search's seemingly impenetrable moat has been threatened by other information resources such as ChatGPT, Claude, TikTok, and Meta Platforms' Instagram . Given the rapid adoption of these tools, it's not unreasonable to assume that time spent on Google Search may decrease .  Alphabet has become a better, more innovative company thanks to tools like ChatGPT . Integrating Gemini across the Alphabet ecosystem could help accelerate the company's growth . Google's days of being the undisputed leader in search are over, but competition isn't inherently bad .  The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years .

" Thomas Wolf, co-founder and chief science officer at Hugging Face, has cast doubt on the belief that current artificial intelligence systems will lead to major scientific breakthroughs . Wolf toldFortunethat today's large language models, or LLMs, excel at providing answers but fall short when it comes to formulating original questions .  Wolf said he initially found the post compelling but became skeptical after rereading it again . Wolf argues that today’s AI systems are built to predict likely outcomes, act as ""yes-men on servers,"" capable of mimicking human responses but incapable of challenging assumptions or generating original ideas .  Wolf also questioned how AI performance is measured today . Wolf cited that real scientific progress often comes from paradigm shifts . He argued that AI needs to demonstrate the ability to challenge its training data .  Hugging Face is a prominent open-source platform in the AI community . Wolf said the landmark victory of DeepMind's AlphaGo over world champions made headlines but was not revolutionary . Wolf concluded that while current models are useful as assistants, scientific progress requires a different kind of intelligence .

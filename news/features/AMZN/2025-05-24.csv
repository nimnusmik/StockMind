Wing VC led the round, joined by Level Up Ventures, Model Ventures' Devang Sachdev, and NVAngels, a group of ex-Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) professionals .  Tensor9 uses a digital twin architecture to make this possible . Each customer environment is mirrored through a virtual replica, which allows vendors to monitor, support, and update deployed software without breaching any privacy firewalls . Logs, metrics, and even hardware issues are fed back to this virtual twin in real time .  Tensor9 began as a bootstrapped project after CEO Ten-Pow realized that System and Organization Controls 2 compliance wasn't the real obstacle stopping startups from closing enterprise deals . Instead, companies wanted software that could run locally, under their own control, with no risk to data sovereignty .  Tensor9 is currently working with AI companies like 11x, Retell AI, and Dyna AI, which need to deliver privacy-preserving solutions to major clients in finance and data-heavy sectors . The company plans to hire additional engineers and refine its platform for wider industry use .  As data privacy rules tighten and AI adoption grows, startups like Tensor9 may be able to redefine how intelligent software reaches the enterprise . Hybrid approach of marrying cloud-like control with on-prem security could be the model that finally unlocks enterprise AI at scale .

" American Express is a beneficiary of continued economic growth in the United States . Amazon has spent hundreds of millions on infrastructure, with much of that in the U.S. The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is centered in America .  The financial services giant has been a mainstay in the United States for over 100 years . American Express has one key difference to other credit card issuers -- it operates its own payments network . Warren Buffett owns more than 21% of the company and 151 million shares .  American Express is a bulletproof stock tailor made to ride the growth of the U.S. consumer spending in the United States by giving customers perks on airlines, hotels, travel, ride sharing, and plenty of basic shopping needs . A beautiful part of American Express' business model is its inflation protection .  Amazon spent $355.7 billion on capital expenditures from 2015 to 2024 . Most of that spending came in the last few years and in the United States . Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, should benefit immensely from the growth of AI . Amazon is at risk if tariffs on China stay elevated for a long time .  Amazon generally makes money by taking a cut of merchant sales, advertising, and its Prime subscription service .

" Warren Buffett is still calling the shots at Berkshire Hathaway but plans to soon turn over investment decisions . Buffett famously likes to invest in safe stocks and I believe that these three are safe bets for the long haul . By the end of 2025, billionaire CEO Warren Buffett intends to turnBerkshire Hathaway over to fellow executive Greg Abel .  Amazon stock is down 17% from its all-time high, which is only the fourth time this decade that it's dropped that much . Amazon Web Services (AWS) has $117 billion in annualized revenue -- if it were a stand-alone business, it would be one of the biggest in the world . The last three times were good times to buy, and I believe this dip will prove to be an opportune moment .  Berkshire owns a larger position in Amazon than in Domino's or Pool . Buffett's company only bought six stocks during the first quarter . Amazon's AWS is its most profitable business venture, with a Q1 operating margin of nearly 40%.  Domino's franchises most of its restaurants, which is a capital-light, high-margin business model . It recently launched new menu items and partnered with DoorDash to increase consumer demand and keep franchisees happy . The consistent generation of free cash flow allows management to repurchase shares .  Buffett more thandoubledhis company's stake in Pool stock -- the biggest percentage increase for the six stocks that Berkshire bought in Q1 . It's surprising because Pool isn't doing great right now . Homeowners aren't installing many new swimming pools, which is a substantial part of this business . Management only expects earnings per share (EPS) of $11.10-$11.60 this year .  In Q1 alone, Pool returned over $100 million to shareholders with buybacks and dividends . Amazon, Domino's, and Pool are three top Buffett stocks for long-term investors . But if I only invested in one today, I would invest in Amazon stock .

" Bill Ackman; Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer; Pershing Square SPARC Holdings Ltd/DE Ryan Israel; Chief Investment Officer; Charles Korn; Investment Team Member; Charles . Korn . Alamanda; Feroz Qayyum; Manning Feng; Anthony Massaro; Sonal Khosla; investment Team Member .  Replay of today's call will be available for two weeks until June 5 at 1:30 PM . To access webcast, please go to pscmevents.com .  The big story of the year so far in the economic perspective has really been the tariffs . We have a lot of confidence in the business' ability to continue to grow, to generate cash, and we'll just talk through some of those characteristics as we mentioned .  China is a big part of the focus where -- China's economy has grown enormously over time and there are a number of unfair practices that otherwise have led to very large balance of trade issues . And the President's approach, as we've seen multiple times in his various negotiations, is a pretty aggressive one .  President Obama is ""cautiously optimistic"" that tariffs will be behind markets and economy by the end of the year . ""We remain pretty optimistic about markets and the economy for a few reasons,"" he says .  The Middle East situation, obviously still, somewhat challenged, but I think, the biggest remaining issue is Iran . The only outlier risk to some degree on the good side, of course, would be tariffs . We view that as more of a one-time effect .  If we had a 10% -- for example, global tariffs, we don't see that as a meaningful, particularly meaningful risk from inflation perspective . So perhaps prospect for the Fed still easing toward the end of the year .  Real estate investment trust has transformed from not much of a cash-generative business on any kind of recurring basis, to today one approaching $300 million of net operating income from income producing real estate assets .  Howard Hughes has been a shareholder for many years . He says he tried to take the company private but couldn't find the capital to keep it private . Pershing Square management company invested $900 million of capital, bought 9 million additional shares .  We paid $100 a share versus a $66 stock price; obviously a very big premium . We did so in order to put us in a position to help transform the company into what we're calling a diversified holding company. company.  We think there's a very small universe of people who are prepared to own a pure play real estate developer. But a much larger base of investors that can own a diversified holding company. If you look at the Berkshire Hathaway market cap, a trillion or so dollars only take, a tiny small fraction of those shareholders to take an interest into Howard Hughes, and we could see a meaningful re-rating in the company.  There are many benefits to building an insurance operation within a diversified holding company in terms of incremental credit support that can be provided by a diverse holding company . We have some discussions underway with a couple of potential CEOs that are would be outstanding choices, and we look forward to reporting back as we make progress .  This was a pretty active quarter for us in terms of the underlying positions that we either trimmed, sold, added to, or had new positions in . Unlike Perkin Square funds, we buy minority interests in public companies .  In the first 4.5 months I should say we trimmed five positions . We sold out of one entirely . We added two existing positions and we bought three entirely new positions .  This first 4.5 months though, given a lot of the backdrop of the markets and the potential economic outcomes actually resulted in a significant number of changes which were running the gamut from modest to pretty substantial .  Uber already, although it's still early, is up about 35% from our cost, and Charles will talk about that position some more detail in just a moment .  In April, we actually sold out entirely of our position in Canadian Pacific, which had held in incredibly well in terms of its share price during a lot of the tariff turmoil that happened in April . And so the reduction of about the high 30%s of UMG brought it back down to what would be more of a typical larger sized position for us .  Pershing Square added a new position, which is Amazon. Brookfield at prices that were about 10% or 12% below where they are now. We also were able to increase a Hertz position .  Amazon has a cloud business called Amazon Web Services, which is leading a lot of the technological revolution as AI and increased computer services are moving off of companies' work sites . Less than 20% of all of the IT workloads are actually in the cloud today .  Amazon tries to build up massive scale, use the advantages of that scale to drive down price, and improve the customer experience . Web Services at 60%, the remaining 40% for Amazon is the retail business . That's the business that we all know and probably use almost on a daily basis today .  Amazon has a virtuous cycle of gaining scale, getting a little bit more profit margin, and then reinvesting a lot back in the customer, is something that unites the businesses and we think has made Amazon very special . We think Andy Jassy, the CEO who's been in the seat for several years, is doing an incredible job of really getting more efficient .  After announcement of tariffs in April, Amazon's share price came down more than 30% . Amazon was trading when we started buying our shares at about 24.5 times earnings, which was the lowest multiple that we've seen ever since we followed the company in its history .  Ackman: ""We carefully study a lot of businesses, we wait very patiently till there are opportunities and given some of the sales that we had ... we had cash on hand to be able to quickly move when we judged that there was a unique opportunity in the market""  We didn't own the stock at the time, and once that deal was publicly announced, we bought a meaningful stake in the company which we've held for the last several years . Events outside of CP's control, I would say have held back some of the potential that we saw at that time, we know it will ultimately be realized .  Most of the companies we own are much more in the asset-light category, not as capital intensive and Amazon led us to make that switch . Hilton, again, is an incredible team led by Chris Nassetta .  Fannie Freddie, a long-standing position, was bought in 2012 for a couple of bucks a share . The Treasury Secretary had an interesting insight when he started talking about the idea of a US sovereign wealth fund . The challenges of trying to reduce leverage and reduce deficit are important ones .  Fannie Freddie are uniquely situated to be great forever assets for the US government to own . It's effectively a royalty in the US housing finance system .  President Trump tweeted that he was looking very seriously about releasing these entities from conservatorship . Director Pulte had various commentary to make clear that his plan is to run these businesses to maximize their profitability consistent with the core mission providing low-cost, long-term fixed-rate financing .  We own 220 million-odd shares collectively above businesses . We have no reason to believe why the President would operate in a way outside of the legal norms for how conservatorships work . We think that tweet is very, very material .  We're extremely encouraged by the President's announcement last night . We're going to cover each of our positions, but in a little less detail than historically, there really have not been a ton of material developments . Uber, there actually has been some material development.  We believe AV technology will not be a winner-take-all market. We believe that there's a partnership structure that is likely to develop with multiple different players partnering to factuate this technology over time. And we believe that's the clear value maximizing strategy for all industry participants. And of course, in the context of that, we think Uber has a central role to play.  Uber successfully launched commercial operations of their Waymo fleet in Austin in March . Waymo and Toyota announced a notable strategic partnership, whereby Waymo will license the AV driver to Toyota, which will be included in the next generation of personally-owned vehicles . Partnerships like this are critical in driving down the production cost as OEMs bring scaled manufacturing to the ecosystem .  Uber has announced a flurry of additional AV partnerships in recent weeks including partnerships with WeRide, Volkswagen, A-Mobility, Momenta and PONY AI .  We see a path for Uber to grow earnings, 50%-plus this year with line of sight for continued 30%-plus compounded earnings growth . Universal Music is generating very substantial operating leverage with EBITDA growing 35% and earnings growing 80% .  The company recruited we think, an excellent CFO. I think helped the company in terms of interfacing with analysts and more traditional public company IR role as well as the company becoming a listed business in the US. We think that will provide some more data to shareholders.  Universal is giving a very valuable product, music entertainment at an incredibly low cost in a subscription format to hundreds of millions of people around the world . It also gives them a very large pricing opportunity for their digital service provider partners such as Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon and others over time to take up prices to better reflect the value you're giving .  The low price point and the recurring nature of it, high value, we think insulates it from the economy, this institutes of the economy . And we think that there's very little tariff exposure to a digital product like this .  Brookfield, the share price has been roughly flat year-to-date . And the stock today is trading just -- and I'll give this context at roughly 14 times earnings . This is, again, against a backdrop where direct peers like Apollo and KKR are trading at 17 to 23 times earnings, respectively .  Brookfield's businesses are focused on essential physical assets . that includes power and renewables, infrastructure, and real estate . They actually have modest exposure to what we consider traditional private equity .  Brookfield has very modest exposure to the more economically sensitive carried interest, and this is, again, a notable difference for some of their peers . Carried interest today is less than 10% of Brookfield's current cash flows .  Google continues to trade at a very discounted valuation relative to its business quality and growth prospects at 18 times forward earnings . We continue to expect attractive growth in 2025 and beyond . And we think the stock is very cheap .  Ads have also been introduced on AI overviews, and they are now monetizing at the same rate as regular search ads . Google is rolling out AI mode, which is more closely resembles that chatbot-like conversational interface directly onto the search page .  AI mode will be able to assume leverage personal contacts from Gmail with the user's consent, obviously, to provide very curated and personalized responses and search . Google is uniquely well positioned to deliver and also highlights the strong network effects of this ecosystem .  Google Cloud, very similar to AWS benefits from that powerful secular trend of IT workloads migrating from on-premise to cloud . And we think that should mitigate a lot of that economic volitilities. And in the meanwhile, the company is generating rapid earnings growth .  The most substantive case is around the default search contract . The RAMDY trial, for that case concluded last week . The final ruling is expected by the end of the summer . We continue to think Google is well positioned to navigate a wide range of remedies .  Restaurant Brands share price has appreciated by about a high single-digit percentage basis . Despite the volatile market environment and an uncertain economic outlook, the company will still grow its operating profit at more than 8% this year .  Restaurant Brands will not be directly impacted by tariffs . The vast majority of input costs in food, beverage and packaging are localized . Restaurant Brands should actually benefit from consumers trading down if the economy enters a recession .  Shares have outperformed the broader market year-to-date, but trade at almost a 30% discount to other franchise restaurants like McDonald's, Yum, and Domino's . We think that leaves ample room for Restaurant Brands to continue to outperform .  A combination of severe winter weather and forest fires have pressured Chipotle sales in the first quarter, same-store sales were down 0.4% . Despite what we thought was actually quite an encouraging launch of Chipotle Honey Chicken, which is the company's new limited time offering .  We don't think that improvement actually requires any improvement in the macro . This is just initiatives that are under management's control . We believe that in times of economic uncertainty, Chipotle's value proposition, which, again, is a meal delivered with fresh ingredients, highly customized, very convenient, all at a 20% to 30% lower cost .  Nike is one of the company that has had a tough start to the year . The stock is down about 19% year-to-date . The other headwind to Nike this year has obviously been tariffs .  The entire athletic footwear and apparel industry manufacturers in Southeast Asia, so they're right in line with peers . If tariffs are not reduced or there's no exemption for the category, this will have to be covered by a variety of actions, including price increases over time .  Two of Nike's retail partners in the US are merging . DICK'S announced its acquisition of Foot Locker on May 15 . The combined company will purchase around 40% of its merchandise from Nike .  Management commentary on the acquisition call was extremely bullish on Nike and DICK's Executive Chairman, Ed Stack, implied that the timing of this deal was influenced in part by Nike's reemphasis on wholesale . Since Dick's went public in 2002, its shares are up 84-fold versus the market, which is up tenfold to 22% -- Bill Ackman .  Ackman: Hilton is very well protected and insulated from both of those risks . The royalty-based nature of the business model means there's really no direct tariff impact. There's been a lot of talk about some secondary impacts .  Hilton is very well protected from inbound travel where international travelers coming to the US has come down substantially . The vast majority of its business is conducted in the United States .  Feroz Qayyum: ""We really like our Hertz investment partly because we think it has an asymmetric range of outcomes, with a potential for its share price to really increase"" Bill Ackman: ""A very impressive team met the senior team, and they clearly have a handle on all the various issues""  The market had discarded this business as structurally unprofitable and burdened with excess leverage . X, formerly known as Twitter, is now on the cusp of profitability . The improvements that the CEO and his team are making can lead to normalized EBITDA .  Hertz is uniquely positioned to benefit from the actual tariffs . Hertz owns about 500,000 vehicle fleet valued at about $12 billion, which are financed through ABS facilities . On the other hand, the broader travel environment has gotten weaker and the company is seeing moderating demand .  A weaker demand environment could make the Hertz turnaround more challenging . Unlike other travel-related industries, Hertz and the car rental companies can really very quickly de-fleet to meet the new realities of the marketplace .  Hertz has an expertise in vehicle maintenance, reconditioning, servicing, and the significant scope and scale of their footprint make it an ideal partner for a company like Uber. significant partner to companies like Uber that are rolling out autonomous vehicles. This could prove to be an entirely new revenue stream for Hertz.  The company expects that will enable significant better insurance recoveries and ideally a better customer experience . Management is talking about as much as $700 million of some combination of revenue cost synergies from that technology .  Pershing Square is basically -- either Ryan or I are going to get compensated for being executives of the company in cash or salary or equity . But in addition to Ryan, effectively the entire Pershing . Square team is being made available to Howard Hughes as part of our arrangement with Howard Hughes .  The management fee is effectively 150 basis points per annum above inflation . Effect, it's almost like a cost reimbursement that we are receiving. effect effect . We've taken through the management company that's owned 90% by the employees .  Howard Hughes is a diversified holding company by growing an insurance operation and by buying controlling or 100% interest in private companies . As that Howard Hughes investment compounds over time, hopefully, we can grow the market cap meaningfully . That means a meaningful reduction in the headline fees paid by the funds that we manage .  Sonal Khosla joined the investment team a few weeks ago . He previously spent time at KKR on their industrial private equity team . Sonal joined KKR out of college and school at University of Pennsylvania .  Sonal is already meaningfully engaged. interesting things that we're working on, we hope to continue to build on Sonal . We look forward to speaking to you soon. Thank you, everyone .",neutral,"tariffs, tariff, prospects, economy, markets"
" Amazon is one of the largest online retailers in the world . E-commerce isn't actually the company's most important business . In the first quarter of 2025, Amazon recorded nearly $64 billion worth of product sales .  Amazon's cost of sales was $77 billion in the first quarter . That's more than $10 billion more than the amount Amazon paid for its Prime membership .  Amazon profits significantly from being a sales platform for others . Its cloud business is a big part of its overall revenue stream . The metrics for its retail business would likely look better if it didn't .  Amazon generated revenue of roughly $156 billion in the first quarter, with services providing nearly half that revenue . Services allow Amazon to spend once to build something and then charge multiple customers fees for using it . Amazon's cloud service is used by many customers, but after its costs are covered, the revenue from each new customer is practically free .  Amazon's operating costs came in at $137 billion, with just over 55% of that figure represented by what amount to product costs . Operating income was a huge $18 billion .

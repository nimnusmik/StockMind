" U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta heard closing arguments Friday from Justice Department lawyers . They argued that a radical shake-up is needed to promote a free and fair market . Google’s legal team argued that only minor concessions are needed and urged the judge not to unduly punish the company with a harsh ruling .  Judge Mehta says he's undecided on how much AI’s potential to shake up the search market should be incorporated in his forthcoming ruling . Google has already vowed to appeal the ruling that branded its search search giant Google .  The Justice Department contends that AI technology by itself won’t rein in Google’s power . Google has already been deploying AI to transform its search engine into an answer engine .  A divestiture of the Chrome browser that Google CEO Sundar Pichai helped build nearly 20 years ago would be among the most effective countermeasures against Google continuing to amass massive volumes of browser traffic and personal data that could be leveraged to retain its dominance in the AI era . Executives from both OpenAi and Perplexity testified last month that they would be eager bidders for the browser if Mehta orders its sale . Apple, mobile app developers, legal scholars and startups also weigh in .  The Cupertino, California, company also told the judge a ban wouldn’t compel it to build its own search engine to compete against Google . A group of legal scholars said the Justice Department’s proposed divestiture of Chrome would be an improper penalty .  Schmidtlein says such a ruling would be a wild overreach .

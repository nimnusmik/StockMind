" Motley Fool analyst David Meier and host Ricky Mulvey discuss On Holding's blistering sales growth . Why pharma investors aren't reacting to President Donald Trump's executive order on drug prices . Then, personal finance expert Robert Brokamp joins Ricky to discuss why investors should consider buying individual bonds .  Stock Advisor’s total average return is 967% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to171% for the S&P 500 . Don’t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you joinStock Advisor .  President Trump signed an executive order that Americans must get a ""Most favored nation price for prescription drugs"" The market for drugs is way more open in the United States than it is in other countries, Meier says . Meier: The market doesn't believe that profits are going away .  Ricky Mulvey: With stocks not really moving on the news, the market says, Well, we look ahead and we don't see how you're going to do this . Governments tend to negotiate on behalf of their people because they're the ones making the purchases .  David Meier: Should you panic? I don't think so, but you should go back given how this all tends to work . Regulation does play a part in many industries, but in pharma specifically, he says .  This is about pricing power, this is about bargaining power . The lobbyist pharma is going to have to roll up their sleeves and do some work over the next 30 days and beyond that . A lot of that gets plowed back into research and development of all kinds to bring the next generation of drugs and new generation of care .  Ricky Mulvey: I've been accused of being too liberal and too conservative on this show, so we'll see what complaints I get this time . The administration would basically say, we don't want to stifle innovation necessarily, but it shouldn't be on Americans alone to fund that innovation when you have other developed countries in the European Union, Australia, for example, paying significantly less for the exact same drug coming out of the same factory .  On Holding reported sales up a blistering 40% from one year ago . The maker of comfortable shoes, where rocks and mulch often get stuck at the base of it, I enjoy wearing them still .  Ricky Mulvey: On Clouds were one of my tariff panic purchases . David Meier: ""I don't own shares, but I was a bit of a sneaker guy. I have tried them, and also like them""  Ricky Mulvey: I credit management for at least at the beginning handling this uncertainty pretty well . But management's discredit, they actually said, we still see plenty of demand for the rest of the year . It was their direct to consumer channel that actually had the best growth .  Nike dipped in a recent quarter, but we'll take that out to be nice to our friends at Nike . This is significant for a younger brand that you would think needs to spend more as a percentage of their sales on marketing or maybe have less negotiating power with shoe stores .  On has the advantage of having a consumer that is more apt to buy in a direct consumer channel, an online e-commerce type channel than Nike had when it was starting out . The other thing I credit is, in addition to putting good technology into their products, they've actually done a good job of building their business from a supply chain management standpoint .  David Meier: Management has done a good job of balancing all the things that they need to balance in terms of creating a good long term business . He gives management a lot of credit for creating a very good business around this .  Wall Street analyst Gil Lurie wants to set the company on fire . He says the only way forward for Alphabet is a complete breakup . The entire business is valued on the worst multiple that investors can find .  Google/Alphabet is by far the biggest business, generates the most cash flow, has the most uncertainty around it today . The search business should be trading at maybe 24 times a weighted average multiple instead of 16 .  The challenge, in my opinion, is where do these companies get their capital from? All of them need investment capital in order to operate, and a lot of that comes from search . David Meier: The internal capital allocation process is taking a much of the cash flow from search and putting it in new businesses, making new investments .  The search business is declining, and Google could be obliterated by ChatGPT . The market might say, well, this is great, but, Waymo, you need a lot of capital going forward . For that, Mr. Market is assigning Alphabet a lower than average earnings multiple about 17 times .  Are we looking at a falling knife here? David Meier: I think shares are probably undervalued, but they're probably a little undervalued for a reason . Meier: There's a lot of risk and uncertainty that's ahead of the company in the short term .

Visit fundrise.com/fool to explore the portfolio, check out historical returns, and see just how much easier investing in real estate can be .  In 2022, the Vanguard total bond market ETF lost about 13% . The main cause of the declines has been the rise of interest rates . When rates go up, the value of existing bonds go down .  The price of the 0.5% treasury has to adjust downward . However, the price of that bond will return to its par value as it gets closer to maturity . One solution is to buy individual bonds instead of bond funds .  Investors typically recover 40% to 60% of the original value of the bonds after a company restructures, gets liquidated . You can feel more secure with a smaller bond portfolio or a smaller number of issuers if you invest primarily in US treasuries .  Robert Brokamp: To minimize the risk of buying bonds from a company that may go belly up, you want to stick with investment grade . Ricky Mulvey: Even if you own individual bonds long enough, you probably will see a couple of defaults . Tripple A bonds have a default rate of only 0.34% .  Brokamp: Every bond has a set maturity rate, but many can be called before then . It's usually because interest rates have dropped or the bonds credit rating has improved . Ricky Mulvey: Another benefit of treasuries is that they're not callable .  Robert Brokamp: When bonds are first sold to investors, what is known as the primary market, they're usually sold in $1,000 increments . But once a bond is issued, it trains on an exchange, which is called the secondary market . At that point, a bond rarely trades for $1000, depending on changes in interest rates and what's going on .  You can avoid all this tax complexity if you buy bonds right when they're issued in the primary market . You're going to increase your chances by having an account with a brokerage that underwrites a lot of bond offerings .  You'll likely see both the coupon and the yield quoted . The coupon was the interest rate on the day the bond was issued . Once the bond begins trading and moving above or below its par value, the yield is a more accurate representation . Most bonds pay interest twice a year .  You can buy savings bonds, treasuries, I bonds, treasury inflation protected securities, otherwise known as tips, directly from the government, commission free @treasurydirect.gov . Unfortunately, it can only be done in taxable accounts because the government isn't set up to serve as a custodian for IRAs .  There's a type of bond ETF that offers most of the benefits of buying individual bonds . These are funds that only own bonds that mature in the same year . You can use these ETFs to invest in all kinds of bonds, corporates, munis, TIPS, high yield bonds .  Like all bond funds, these ETFs are going to go up and down in value depending on what's going on with interest rates in the economy . They should return close to their initial share price, that is the price of the ETF on its very first day . But there are no guarantees, and this is more likely if the ETF invests in safer bonds .

Over the last 12 months, IonQ has only generated $43 million in sales . The company has won over the likes of Nvidia,Microsoft,Amazon, and Alphabetas key customers and partners .  Palantir is proving that its software platforms are an integral component to AI roadmaps across the public and private sectors . Nvidia already has its own quantum computing platform, called CUDA-Q . Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon have each built their own quantum chips .  IonQ has already experienced its ""Palantir moment"" and I see pressure on the stock as the more likely outcome .

" Meta Platforms has a clear roadmap for how AI can improve its business over the long run . Nvidia has been the biggest winner from AI spending so far, but the second-order effects of the trend could be even bigger .  Nvidia has been a huge beneficiary over the last few years from the massive artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending by the hyperscalers . Its cutting-edge GPUs (graphics processing units) are unparalleled when it comes to training large language models in the most cost-efficient manner . Nvidia is selling its chips just as fast as they're manufactured .  Meta looks best positioned to take advantage of everything large language models and generative AI can do . Meta has been a big investor in artificial intelligence for a long time . It'll just take some time for the company to fully realize the impact of AI on its business .  Meta used to require advertisers to select a target audience for their ad creatives . Generative AI has the potential to unlock a ton of value for Meta's business . As a result, there's more emphasis on the ad creative .  Meta stands to benefit from building several different types of AI agents . Mark Zuckerberg: ""Our goal is to make it so that any business can basically tell us what objective they're trying to achieve ... and then we just do the rest""  Meta could benefit from developing customer service agents and sales agents for its messaging apps . That could enable businesses to deepen their relationships with prospective and existing customers without spending significantly on overhead . Eventually, Meta could use AI to generate bespoke content for each user .  Meta could create an endless feed of hyper-specific personalized content . AI-generated ad campaigns become just as personalized and even indistinguishable from entertainment in Meta's feeds . The company has already seen success with integrating Meta AI into a pair of glasses .  Meta Platforms is well positioned to own that format with its 10-year head start . Zuckerberg envisions AI generating unique content for users on Facebook and Instagram . That's the type of content that could push AR and VR headsets forward .

" Bernstein estimates that Google could save billions of dollars annually on its custom AI chips . Analysts say TPUs offer about “~4x performance per dollar vs. current-gen GPU . Much of this advantage is said to stem from high margins on rival graphics processing units .  “Moore’s Law isn’t sufficient,” the analysts noted, as it cuts cost per operation by just 25%–40% annually, while model size grows roughly 3.5x per year . Some hyperscalers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google are building ASICs in-house . Others—including Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI, are dependent on external providers .",neutral,"gpu, cost, microsoft, estimates, performance"
" Motley Fool analyst David Meier and host Ricky Mulvey discuss On Holding's blistering sales growth . Why pharma investors aren't reacting to President Donald Trump's executive order on drug prices . Then, personal finance expert Robert Brokamp joins Ricky to discuss why investors should consider buying individual bonds .  Stock Advisor’s total average return is 967% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to171% for the S&P 500 . Don’t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you joinStock Advisor .  President Trump signed an executive order that Americans must get a ""Most favored nation price for prescription drugs"" The market for drugs is way more open in the United States than it is in other countries, Meier says . Meier: The market doesn't believe that profits are going away .  Ricky Mulvey: With stocks not really moving on the news, the market says, Well, we look ahead and we don't see how you're going to do this . Governments tend to negotiate on behalf of their people because they're the ones making the purchases .  David Meier: Should you panic? I don't think so, but you should go back given how this all tends to work . Regulation does play a part in many industries, but in pharma specifically, he says .  This is about pricing power, this is about bargaining power . The lobbyist pharma is going to have to roll up their sleeves and do some work over the next 30 days and beyond that . A lot of that gets plowed back into research and development of all kinds to bring the next generation of drugs and new generation of care .  Ricky Mulvey: I've been accused of being too liberal and too conservative on this show, so we'll see what complaints I get this time . The administration would basically say, we don't want to stifle innovation necessarily, but it shouldn't be on Americans alone to fund that innovation when you have other developed countries in the European Union, Australia, for example, paying significantly less for the exact same drug coming out of the same factory .  On Holding reported sales up a blistering 40% from one year ago . The maker of comfortable shoes, where rocks and mulch often get stuck at the base of it, I enjoy wearing them still .  Ricky Mulvey: On Clouds were one of my tariff panic purchases . David Meier: ""I don't own shares, but I was a bit of a sneaker guy. I have tried them, and also like them""  Ricky Mulvey: I credit management for at least at the beginning handling this uncertainty pretty well . But management's discredit, they actually said, we still see plenty of demand for the rest of the year . It was their direct to consumer channel that actually had the best growth .  Nike dipped in a recent quarter, but we'll take that out to be nice to our friends at Nike . This is significant for a younger brand that you would think needs to spend more as a percentage of their sales on marketing or maybe have less negotiating power with shoe stores .  On has the advantage of having a consumer that is more apt to buy in a direct consumer channel, an online e-commerce type channel than Nike had when it was starting out . The other thing I credit is, in addition to putting good technology into their products, they've actually done a good job of building their business from a supply chain management standpoint .  David Meier: Management has done a good job of balancing all the things that they need to balance in terms of creating a good long term business . He gives management a lot of credit for creating a very good business around this .  Wall Street analyst Gil Lurie wants to set the company on fire . He says the only way forward for Alphabet is a complete breakup . The entire business is valued on the worst multiple that investors can find .  Google/Alphabet is by far the biggest business, generates the most cash flow, has the most uncertainty around it today . The search business should be trading at maybe 24 times a weighted average multiple instead of 16 .  The challenge, in my opinion, is where do these companies get their capital from? All of them need investment capital in order to operate, and a lot of that comes from search . David Meier: The internal capital allocation process is taking a much of the cash flow from search and putting it in new businesses, making new investments .  The search business is declining, and Google could be obliterated by ChatGPT . The market might say, well, this is great, but, Waymo, you need a lot of capital going forward . For that, Mr. Market is assigning Alphabet a lower than average earnings multiple about 17 times .  Are we looking at a falling knife here? David Meier: I think shares are probably undervalued, but they're probably a little undervalued for a reason . Meier: There's a lot of risk and uncertainty that's ahead of the company in the short term .

Visit fundrise.com/fool to explore the portfolio, check out historical returns, and see just how much easier investing in real estate can be .  In 2022, the Vanguard total bond market ETF lost about 13% . The main cause of the declines has been the rise of interest rates . When rates go up, the value of existing bonds go down .  The price of the 0.5% treasury has to adjust downward . However, the price of that bond will return to its par value as it gets closer to maturity . One solution is to buy individual bonds instead of bond funds .  Investors typically recover 40% to 60% of the original value of the bonds after a company restructures, gets liquidated . You can feel more secure with a smaller bond portfolio or a smaller number of issuers if you invest primarily in US treasuries .  Robert Brokamp: To minimize the risk of buying bonds from a company that may go belly up, you want to stick with investment grade . Ricky Mulvey: Even if you own individual bonds long enough, you probably will see a couple of defaults . Tripple A bonds have a default rate of only 0.34% .  Brokamp: Every bond has a set maturity rate, but many can be called before then . It's usually because interest rates have dropped or the bonds credit rating has improved . Ricky Mulvey: Another benefit of treasuries is that they're not callable .  Robert Brokamp: When bonds are first sold to investors, what is known as the primary market, they're usually sold in $1,000 increments . But once a bond is issued, it trains on an exchange, which is called the secondary market . At that point, a bond rarely trades for $1000, depending on changes in interest rates and what's going on .  You can avoid all this tax complexity if you buy bonds right when they're issued in the primary market . You're going to increase your chances by having an account with a brokerage that underwrites a lot of bond offerings .  You'll likely see both the coupon and the yield quoted . The coupon was the interest rate on the day the bond was issued . Once the bond begins trading and moving above or below its par value, the yield is a more accurate representation . Most bonds pay interest twice a year .  You can buy savings bonds, treasuries, I bonds, treasury inflation protected securities, otherwise known as tips, directly from the government, commission free @treasurydirect.gov . Unfortunately, it can only be done in taxable accounts because the government isn't set up to serve as a custodian for IRAs .  There's a type of bond ETF that offers most of the benefits of buying individual bonds . These are funds that only own bonds that mature in the same year . You can use these ETFs to invest in all kinds of bonds, corporates, munis, TIPS, high yield bonds .  Like all bond funds, these ETFs are going to go up and down in value depending on what's going on with interest rates in the economy . They should return close to their initial share price, that is the price of the ETF on its very first day . But there are no guarantees, and this is more likely if the ETF invests in safer bonds .

" IonQ has witnessed its share price rise by more than 270% over just the last year . IonQ's burst onto the scene is reminiscent of another now-hot AI stock: Palantir Technologies . Quantum computing is quickly emerging as a trendy opportunity in the AI world .  IonQ's market cap currently hovers around $8 billion -- putting the company's P/S ratio right around 165 . Over the last 12 months, IonQ has only generated $43 million in sales . The company has won over the likes of Nvidia,Microsoft,Amazon, and Alphabetas key customers and partners .  Palantir is proving that its software platforms are an integral component to AI roadmaps across the public and private sectors . Nvidia already has its own quantum computing platform, called CUDA-Q . Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon have each built their own quantum chips .  IonQ has already experienced its ""Palantir moment"" and I see pressure on the stock as the more likely outcome . I'd pass on investing in IonQ and opt for more established opportunities in the AI sector across megacap tech .

" Meta Platforms has a clear roadmap for how AI can improve its business over the long run . Nvidia has been the biggest winner from AI spending so far, but the second-order effects of the trend could be even bigger .  Nvidia has been a huge beneficiary over the last few years from the massive artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending by the hyperscalers . Its cutting-edge GPUs (graphics processing units) are unparalleled when it comes to training large language models in the most cost-efficient manner . Nvidia is selling its chips just as fast as they're manufactured .  Meta looks best positioned to take advantage of everything large language models and generative AI can do . Meta has been a big investor in artificial intelligence for a long time . It'll just take some time for the company to fully realize the impact of AI on its business .  Meta used to require advertisers to select a target audience for their ad creatives . Generative AI has the potential to unlock a ton of value for Meta's business . As a result, there's more emphasis on the ad creative .  Meta stands to benefit from building several different types of AI agents . Mark Zuckerberg: ""Our goal is to make it so that any business can basically tell us what objective they're trying to achieve ... and then we just do the rest""  Meta could benefit from developing customer service agents and sales agents for its messaging apps . That could enable businesses to deepen their relationships with prospective and existing customers without spending significantly on overhead . Eventually, Meta could use AI to generate bespoke content for each user .  Meta could create an endless feed of hyper-specific personalized content . AI-generated ad campaigns become just as personalized and even indistinguishable from entertainment in Meta's feeds . The company has already seen success with integrating Meta AI into a pair of glasses .  Meta Platforms is well positioned to own that format with its 10-year head start . Zuckerberg envisions AI generating unique content for users on Facebook and Instagram . That's the type of content that could push AR and VR headsets forward .

" Elon Musk's xAI, a rival to ChatGPT, has been building a supercomputer leveraging clusters of Nvidia's chips . The company is reportedly eyeing 1 million additional GPUs, which could cost an estimated $40 billion .

The initial stage of development for the supercomputer, called Colossus, used100,000 Nvidia cards .  Elon Musk has doubled down on securing more GPUs for Colossus 2 . At the time, he implied that the next cluster would be five times larger than the current infrastructure .

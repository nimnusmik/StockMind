" Alphabet (Google) has been the worst performer among the Mag 7, with the stock down about 11% YTD . Since February, I've watched the share price drop hard from around $207 to $141 . While the S&P 500 has recovered most of its losses, Google has barely clawed back a third of what it lost .  At about $170 per share, I see Google as a rare combo of a solid growth business trading at a pretty reasonable price . Google already has an extensive global network of data centers built out over years to power search .  A lot of investors seem worried about how much Google is spending on AI and building more data centers . I think this gives Google a real edge when it comes to competing in AI, because it owns the entire tech stack and has direct access to the world's largest information index .  Some people are saying search is over because users turn to AI now, but Google's Search revenue tells a different story . Google only lost 6 basis points of market share month-over-month which is less than 1% annualized . Adjusted for seasonality, search is doing better than ever .  Google only shows ads on around 20% of queries, which are the ones that actually bring in money . Losing non-monetizable traffic isn't the same thing as losing revenue . Even if a company like Apple builds its own AI, it would still need massive data resources .  In the most recent quarter, revenue grew 12% YoY which beat expectations of around 10% . Search is bouncing back because of strong demand for ad space and high-intent queries . Cloud revenue came in a bit lighter than Azure, at 28% growth, but that's mainly due to temporary capacity issues .  Last year's gross margin was around 58.5%, and I think this will keep trending up . Operating margin might have dipped recently, but I expect it to rise from about 33% now to around 36% by 2030 . With nearly $95 billion in cash and only around $11 billion in debt, they're in a great spot financially . Even with the elevated CapEx, Google still has the ability to pay a dividend .  Google really feels like it's trading more like a classic value stock than a typical high-growth tech name . Right now, it has solid double-digit revenue and earnings growth that I think can keep going strong for years . But despite that, it's only trading at around 19x earnings .  Google's stock already justifies its current price purely on the strength of the existing business . If Google can keep delivering and showing its edge in AI, it could see its P/E multiple expand back toward 25x over the next year or two . That would push the stock toward a target price of $224, which is more than 30% higher .  Google has a strong case for long-term upside, and right now, it feels like you're paying a fair price just for the current business . I'm confident this upside is very much within reach . I also dug into the latest 13F filings to see what the marquee investors are doing .  Google's pullbackdown about 11% YTD and lagging the rest of the Mag 7doesn't reflect the strength I see in its business . At roughly 19x earnings, Google trades well below its 10-year average of nearly 30x and below peers even without the same AI story . The real pivot here is Google's shift into a fully integrated AI .  A move back toward 25x earnings over the next year or two puts a $224 price target within reach, implying more than 30% upside . Investors should watch for high CapEx stressing free cash flow, potential antitrust headwinds, and competition from other AI players .  Google is one of the best names to own right now .

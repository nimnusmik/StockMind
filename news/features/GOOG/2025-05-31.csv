" US District Judge Amit Mehta will decide whether to splinter the company's search empire . The Justice Department prevailed in the initial liability phase of the antitrust trial . During the remedy phase, the DOJ argued that Google should sell off its Chrome browser, share its search data with rivals .  Google still has to contend with another antitrust trial that has reached the remedies phase related to its online advertising technology business . If Mehta agrees with the DOJ’s proposals, Google would have to change much of its current search business .  Losing Chrome, which uses Google as its default search engine, could cut Google off from its users . Forcing the company to end its exclusivity contracts with other tech firms would also impact Google . Google has argued that the DOJ’s recommended remedies go too far .  Apple said in April that search queries in Apple’s Safari browser were down for the first time in April . Google disputed the claim, saying it continues to see growth across its products .

" Congress’s own tax scorekeeper is predicting a ‘revenge’ tax would drive foreign investors away from US markets . Wall Street analysts are warning the provision would create another disincentive for foreign investors . The item would increase tax rates for individuals and companies from countries that the US deems “discriminatory”  Congress’s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation assessed it would lead to a “decline in foreign demand for US direct and portfolio investment” and “general avoidance and compliance behavior” by foreign companies in response to the retaliatory taxes . The JCT has estimated the provision will bring in $116.3 billion in revenue .  Section 899 would ultimately lower annual US tax revenues by $12.9 billion in 2033 and 2034, committee says . US assets as a whole have been underperformers this year as Trump’s policies put a dent in the narrative of “America exceptionalism”  Foreign investment in US long-term securities, including stocks and bonds, amounts to around $31 trillion . Foreign accounts’ share of US Treasury debt has slid in the last decade, but they still hold about a third of the $29 trillion outstanding .

" Nvidia trades at much higher valuation multiples than Alphabet, making it an expensive bet on future AI growth . Alphabet's stable business and lower valuation make it appealing for value-focused investors . Nvidia still has upside potential for a certain type of high-growth investors .  Nvidia's stock price has multiplied by 8 in about 30 months . Nvidia's business may be booming, but those shares are changing hands at the lofty valuation of 25 times sales . Many investors will look no further, walking away from these deal-breaking valuation multiples .  An overwhelming majority of analysts tracking this stock call it a ""buy"" and the average one-year price target is about 24% above the current value . Nvidia can charge very high prices for its AI accelerator chips and be more limited by manufacturing capacity than by customer demand . Nvidia's profits have skyrocketed much faster than the plain top-line sales .  Alphabet makes more money than Nvidia, even after the chip guru's massive growth spurt . The Google parent's annual revenues are about three times the size of Nvidia's . That makes Alphabet a value-oriented bet on the generative AI boom .  The company just might be able to stave off AI chip rivals for years to come, until the ballooning valuation finally makes sense . Alphabet is a much more tempting idea, pairing the company's ultimate longevity with a very reasonable share price . It's one of my favorite investments of all time, and a particularly strong buy at today's modest valuation .

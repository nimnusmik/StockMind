" Alphabet's search engine dominance looks safe despite potential challenges from AI-powered alternatives . The company has several other growth avenues, including cloud computing, streaming, and self-driving cars . While the stock hasn't performed well this year, Alphabet's long-term prospects remain attractive .  Recent court testimony from anAppleexecutive, Eddy Cue, suggests that the iPhone maker wants to add AI-based functionalities to its Safari browser search option . When ChatGPT first made its grand entrance, the market reacted similarly and sold off Alphabet's shares .  Alphabet's strong brand name in the search engine market, massive market share (in the neighborhood of 90%) and innovative abilities should allow it to remain a leader in search . The company has other significant growth opportunities that will serve one major purpose beyond helping it improve revenue and earnings .  Google Cloud is one of the ""Big Three"" in cloud computing . YouTube and Google Cloud have a combined annual run rate of $110 billion . That's about 31% of the company's 2024 annual revenue of $350 billion .  Alphabet could be a major winner if self-driving cars become far more widespread . Even without that, Alphabet's business has excellent long-term prospects . Despite the company's poor performance, it's worth investing in its shares .  Stock Advisor’s total average return is975% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to172% for the S&P 500 . If you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $829,879!",positive,"alphabet, stock, google, cloud, market"
" Investors can often simplify their investment choices by buying stock in established, wealth-building companies . These large-cap stocks have not only stayed at the top of industries they helped transform but have also focused on plans that can keep them on a growth trajectory for years to come .  Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit is the world's largest cloud services provider . Amazon also has a lucrative advertising business that generated $56 billion in annual revenue in 2024 .  Amazon already utilizes nearly 1 million robots supporting its warehouse and logistics operations . As the company scales up its use of robots, Amazon should realize increased profits as its margins expand . Investors looking for a long-term buy-and-hold candidate shouldn't overlook Amazon stock .  The Taiwan-based semiconductor giant jumped to a technical lead in the last decade as chip design companies turned to outside fabs . The company plans to spend approximately $40 billion in capital expenditures (capex) in 2025 .  TSMC generated almost $26 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2025, a 42% yearly increase .

" Stocks entered the green for the year as investors cheered the US-China trade thaw . The ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks continued theirrenewed ascent . Earnings from economic bellwethers Cisco (CSCO) and Walmart (WMT) didn't completely suck .  Ex-Medtronic CEO Bill George says CEOs should get away from corporate guidance . He says earnings estimates and corporate guidance are useless in a backdrop where one social media post could blow up company's financial planning .  Walmart reiterated its full-year earnings per share forecast on Thursday after ratcheting down expectations at an investor event several weeks ago . Executives went on to say they would start raising prices (by raising prices)  If tariffs go back to pre-thaw levels, it may render guidance obsolete . Yet, the guidance is out there . Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz decided to pull guidance altogether because of trade uncertainty . United Airlines (UAL) still has its double guidance range out there(which numerous execs have privately made fun of). Yet despite all the confusion, we have the Street looking for earnings growth north of 10% this year .  Earnings estimates and guidance have historically proven to be important drivers of stock prices . To the extent they no longer are, I view it as one more problem for investors to contend with in a challenging 2025 .",negative,"earnings, executives, stocks, stock, forecast"
" Nvidia has a history of beating Wall Street's earnings estimates . Hints from several major customers are encouraging about the demand for Nvidia's GPUs . Strong demand could boost Nvidia's Q1 results and its outlook for the rest of the year .  Nvidia has topped consensus Wall Street earnings estimates in each of the previous four quarters by at least 5%. Granted, an earnings beat doesn't always translate to a bump in Nvidia's share price . But my hunch is that investors are looking for a reason to be bullish about the once high-flying stock again .  Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in his company's Q1 earnings call that Amazon Web Services has been aggressive in installing Nvidia AI chips as well as its own Trainium chips . Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and its parentAlphabet, highlighted Google's ties with Nvidia . CFO Amy Hood said in her Q3 earnings call, that demand is outpacing capacity for AI services .  Nvidia plans to launch its Blackwell Ultra GPU in the second half of this year . Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated in his company's last quarterly update that demand for the new GPUs is ""extraordinary"" Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer Nvidia's B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs to customers .  Nvidia could beat earnings expectations and provide an optimistic outlook for the rest of the year . But if the trade dynamics change for the worse between now and May 28, that might not be enough to propel the stock higher over the near term . Over the long term, I think Nvidia's future remains bright .  Nvidia, Apple, Netflix and Netflix are all about to pop . If you invest $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you'd have $351,127! Nvidia: If you invested in Apple in 2008, you’d have $40,106! Netflix: $642,582! Now is the best time to buy before it's too late .

" The digital gaming platform is partnering with Google on immersive advertising . The partnership could help scale Roblox's advertising business in the long run . Investors will want to monitor the execution in the coming quarters .  Partnership gives Roblox instant access to a broad network of brands and agencies . Rewarded video ads let users voluntarily watch up to 30 seconds of full-screen video in exchange for in-game rewards . Early tests were promising, with average completion rates exceeding 80% and some experiences over 90% .  The partnership with Google could be transformative for several reasons . By integrating with Google's ad infrastructure, Roblox becomes accessible to millions of advertisers who are already using Google Ads . Equally important is that by rolling out rewarded video ads, the company is accelerating its efforts to grow its advertising revenue .  The rewarded video ads let users gain in-game rewards, which could improve user engagement . Developers can generate additional income from ads inserted in their games . Roblox must ensure that the ads do not hurt users' experience, especially its core audience .  Roblox must balance advertising (and the nature of the advertising content) with regulatory and safety issues . Failure to do that could impact the relationship with parents and regulators . Equally important to monitor is advertisers' return on investment (ROI)  Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down’s alerts for three incredible companies, available when you joinStock Advisor, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon .

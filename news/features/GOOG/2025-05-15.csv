" Iowa's Grinnell College has grown its endowment to $2.7 billion, helping fund one of the most generous financial-aid programs in the country . Draft tax bill released by House Republicans proposes significantly raising taxes on private universities .  Lawmakers proposed a 21% tax rate for schools that have an endowment of at least $2 million per pupil . The scale then slides to 14% for colleges with endowments totaling more $1.25 million per student . At Grinnell, a 179-year-old college about an hour’s drive from Des Moines, more than 90% of students receive some form of aid .  The current 1.4% tax rate applies to schools with endowments of at least $500,000 per student . That generated more than $380 million from 56 colleges and universities in 2023, affecting just a fraction of the 1,700 private, nonprofit schools across the country . Now, the wealthiest colleges would face a levy equivalent to the 21% corporate tax rate .  The House tax-writing committee says it holds elite universities accountable . Universities have said that higher taxes will come at the expense of the neediest students . Harvard, for example, tapped the Republican-friendly lobbying firm that used to employ Attorney General Pam Bondi .  Details of the proposals could still change as the tax bill wends its way through Congress . Swarthmore, with about 1,700 students, relies on its endowment for more than 60% of its annual operating budget . Grinnell’s Harris said she has been speaking with Republican Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley about the tax .  Pomona’s acting president says the proposed levy would hit the Southern California school with a $40 million tax hike . Even the most prestigious schools could see their credit ratings pressured by the endowment tax .  When he joined the board, the college’s endowment was less than $100,000 . Rosenfield was an attorney whose family owned Younkers department stores across Iowa . He turned to Omaha's Buffett after being introduced to him by a cousin . The two men often shared ideas during late-night phone calls .  The levy for colleges with 5,000 students or less should remain at 1.4%, Harris says .

" We recently published a list of12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Invest in Now . We are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other best quantum computing stocks to invest in now .  Quantum computing is a new type of computing that uses the strange rules of quantum physics to solve really hard problems . Unlike regular computers that use bits (which are either 0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits (quantum bits), which can be both 0 and 1 at the same time . This lets them handle a lot more information at once . Qubits can be linked together in a special way called entanglement, which makes them even more powerful .  Quantum computers have potential to process exponentially larger datasets and perform calculations that would otherwise take years . This could lead to breakthroughs in areas like drug discovery, supply chain optimization, and financial modeling . The company is actively developing quantum algorithms specifically designed to complement AI models .  Insider Monkey compiled the list of 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Invest in Now . Chapman envisions a future where quantum computing becomes a critical tool for AI development, enabling smarter, faster, and more efficient solutions .  Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is considered a quantum computing company primarily through its research arm, Google Quantum AI . The company is at the forefront of quantum computing development, aiming to build practical, scalable quantum computers . In 2019, the company claimed to achieve “quantum supremacy”, where its 53-qubit quantum processor, “Sycamore” completed a task in 200 seconds that would take the fastest classical supercomputers thousands of years .  A processor achieved a Random Circuit Sampling task in approximately five minutes . This is a computation that would take classical supercomputers about 10^25 years . A significant advancement is its ability to perform “below threshold” quantum error correction . In February 2025, Google Quantum AI announced a partnership with the University of Chicago and University of Tokyo .  Google’s advancements in quantum computing position it as a leader in the field . While the industry remains in early stages, these developments suggest a growing momentum toward practical quantum applications in the coming years .

" An Apple executive believes AI will replace standard search engines shortly . Google is already implementing AI overviews . The stock is dirt cheap for its growth .  In 2022, Alphabet paid Apple $20 billion to be the default search engine on Apple's products . This landed Alphabet in hot water and was a key factor in the illegal monopoly case against Google . Apple's executive Eddy Cue mentioned that Apple may offer AI-powered search alternatives to users rather than defaulting to Google .  If Apple gave users the choice of what platform they'd use, Alphabet would likely lose some revenue due to some users opting for an alternative to Google . If that happened, Alphabet's profits would jump by $20 billion immediately . Alphabet's stock recently traded for a dirt-cheap 16 times forward earnings .  The rest of the market may be a bit fearful about Alphabet's stock, I think the pessimism is unwarranted . If Alphabet doesn't have to pay Apple $20 billion, an expense would be eliminated overnight and added directly to Alphabet's earnings .

" Apple depends on a huge payment from Alphabet to make Google the default search engine on its products . Apple's vice president of services, Eddy Cue, recently said in a testimony to federal court that he ""loses sleep"" over the thought of losing that revenue . Alphabet paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 for this commitment, but there is no public information about that payment .  Apple's stock could be primed for a crash if this profit source disappeared . Cue was testifying in federal court regarding the ongoing Google search engine illegal monopoly case . The $20 billion payment was a huge part of this case .  Apple's trailing12-month net income has essentially hovered at or slightly below the $100 billion mark for the past three years . If Apple were to lose that lucrative payment from Alphabet, Apple's net income would likely drop around 20% .

Apple's stock is priced for perfection and growth, yet both of those assumptions are being called into question right now .

The release didn't specify when the Marines will reach the city, while LA’s police chief warned that his department had no formal notification .

Jimmy Gomez says . Mayor Karen Bass has said there were at least five raids on Monday . Newsom suggests the National Guard may be used to support a broader immigration crackdown .

Law generally bars the use of the active-duty US military to carry out domestic law enforcement . California and Newsom filed a 22-page complaint late Monday in federal court . The governor urged a judge to void the president’s orders and transfer the National Guard from Defense Department control .  Newsom and Bass have accused Trump of making the situation worse . Trump said sending in the National Guard was a “great decision,” derided the idea that the protests were largely peaceful . The president also backed comments from his border adviser Tom Homan, who threatened to arrest state and local officials who obstruct immigration enforcement .  President Trump says Gavin Newsom is ""grossly incompetent"" Newsom hasn't done anything at this time to warrant arrest, says Tom Homan .

" IBM is building the first large-scale quantum computer capable of operating without errors . The computer, called Starling, is set to launch by 2029 . IBM stock hit an all-time high of $273.27 on Monday, more than the S&P 500's roughly 12% gain .  IBM’s Starling is a “significant” development for the quantum computing market, IDC quantum analyst Heather West said . Once developed, useful quantum computers would solve problems that would take “classical” computers billions of years .  IBM says Starling will be able to run large-scale quantum operations without error . Unlike traditional computers that use bits or series of 1s and 0s, quantum machines use qubits . Qubits are a function of quantum mechanics and, rather than being expressed as a 1 or 0, can exist as both at the same time, allowing for far more processing capabilities .  IBM will use a code called qLDPC requiring its quantum computers to use fewer qubits . The company says this will allow it to scale the computers without making them less accurate . Google also said it achieved this feat with its Willow chip in late 2024 .  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in January that useful quantum computing was decades away . Horvath expects “useful’s quantum computers will arrive within the next five years . Tech CEOs have previously projected longer timelines .",positive,"qubits, ibm, computing, computers, starling"

" AI-driven large language models gobble information in a race to dominate the web’s frontier . The latest of the AI scraping wars is between Reddit and AI startupAnthropic . Reddit claims that Anthropic intentionally scraped Reddit users' personal data without their consent .  Anthropic is also defending itself against a separate suit from music publishers . The case adds to a growing number of high-profile cases where copyright holders have tried to guard their works from the reach of technology firms .  The court rejected Ross's argument that it could use the summaries under the concept offair use, which allows copyrights to be used for news reporting, teaching, research, criticism, and commentary . The New York Times (NYT) filed a lawsuit accusing OpenAI and Microsoft of illegally using millions of published stories to train OpenAI’s language models .  Getty Images is trying to chip away at the same argument in lawsuits filed in 2023 against AI image generation startup Stability . Stability argues that fair use justified training its technology on copyrighted material .  In 2005, the Authors Guild sued Google over millions of books that the tech giant scanned and made available in “snippets” to online searchers . Google didn’t pay for the copyrighted information but did provide word-for-word pieces of the copyrighted works in search results . The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reasoned in adecision that Google’s scanning project tested the limits of fair use but was “transformative” and therefore protected under fair use law .  Google could be drawn into the new AI scraping wars as part of a landmark antitrust case against Google’s Search monopoly that was won last year by the US Justice Department . The DOJ has argued that the search giant could further entrench its dominance by training its AI model, Gemini, on its vast index of internet content .",negative,"copyrights, lawsuits, copyright, lawsuit, sued"

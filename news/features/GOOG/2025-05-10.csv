" Apple is exploring adding AI services to its web browser for which Google now pays an estimated $20 billion a year to be the default search engine . Apple's Safari searches on Apple’s Safari fell for the first time last month, according to Eddy Cue .  Alphabet shares ended the week down nearly 7%, while the Nasdaq 100 fell just 0.2% . The drop erased $138 billion in market value . Google search accounts for more than half of the parent company's revenue .  The size and speed of Alphabet’s selloff shows how nervousness about the risks of disruption from AI is overshadowing everything else . Alphabet has long traded at a discount to megacap peers like Microsoft Corp.  More than 80% of the 76 analysts tracked by Bloomberg who cover the company have buy ratings . Alphabet trades nearly 30% below the average analyst price target, a higher return potential than others .  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. plunged after China's leading chipmaker warned sales could fall as much as 6% this quarter .

" A decade ago, when Microsoft Corp. was reined in by the Justice Department, a prominent Silicon Valley attorney popularized a theory about antitrust cases: “The trial is the remedy” The theory meant forcing a monopolist to defend its conduct could open up space for other companies to innovate . And today, it's happening with Alphabet Inc.’s Google .  Apple’s top dealmaker Eddy Cue said Apple is “actively looking at” revamping its Safari web browser to focus on AI-powered search engines . His comments indicate that while Google has worked to protect its core search business, AI companies have succeeded in building a viable alternative for answering questions on the internet .  The whole point of monopolization trials “is to shake things up,” Wu says . The second phase of the Google trial focused on how to address what a federal judge last year found to be an illegal monopoly . After closing arguments May 29 and 30, Judge Amit Mehta will determine whether to break up the company .  Apple had partnered with Google on online search since 2003, earning as much as $20 billion a year for making Google’s search engine the default option on its devices . Cue was intimately involved in negotiating that deal – in fact he had testified about it in 2023 as part of the first phase of its antitrust case .  Cue barely mentioned Gemini this week when he appeared in court for the Justice Department’s second phase trial . Cue appeared to be alluding to what Silicon Valley has described as an existential threat to search over the past two years . Apple still has yet to sign a deal to add Gemini to its phones .  Users can now get instant AI-generated answers directly from bots, which are drawing their responses from large repositories of existing human-generated data . Google said it has seen an overall increase in queries from Apple devices as users switch from text-based searches to using voice-activated and image-based search .  Google discovered the key technology for the large language models that underlies today’s AI startups . The government has argued that Google didn’t capitalize on that innovation because of its dominance in the market . Google maintains that it spends billions on innovation each year and waited to introduce AI features so that it could do so responsibly .  Google is concerned that people might then use landline phones less, Wu called it ""paranoia"" Google said the company hasn't seen AI cannibalize search, with only a small slice of homework and coding queries shifting .

" Google agrees to a $50 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by Black current and former employees . The lead plaintiff in Curley v. Google, LLC, designed outreach programs to allow the technology giant to recruit students at historically Black colleges and universities .  The settlement would not require mandatory arbitration agreements for employment-related disputes through and including August 2026 . Similar news came in 2021, when Google agreed to pay $3.8 million to settle pay discrimination claims at California and Washington state locations .  The lead plaintiff alleged that Google ‘under-leveled’ her by assigning her a seniority level lower than that suggested by her education attainment and professional experience . Google has faced criticism of its pay practices in the past, with one internal survey reportedly finding a decline in employee pay satisfaction .

" FTC says DOJ's proposal to make Google share search data with competitors includes adequate safeguards to protect users' privacy . DOJ says it is necessary to open up the online search market after ruling in August that the tech titan holds an illegal monopoly . Google has sought to block the DOJ's data-sharing proposal, which its CEO Sundar Pichai said would give away the company's intellectual property .  DOJ and state attorneys general want to make Google sell off Chrome browser and cease multi-billion dollar payments to Apple and other companies that set Google as the default search engine on new devices . FTC said the proposal would appoint a committee to oversee compliance, similar to agency's privacy-related settlements .

" A preliminary settlement covering more than 4,000 Google employees in California and New York was filed on Thursday evening . Plaintiffs in the proposed class action said Google has a ""racially biased corporate culture"" Black employees comprised only 4.4% of Google's workforce and 3% of its leadership in 2021 .  Lawyers for the plaintiffs may seek up to $12.5 million of the settlement fund in fees . The lawsuit began in March 2022 after a regulator started investigating Google's treatment of Black female employees . Google denies wrongdoing in agreeing to settle, says it fully complied with all laws .  The case is being heard in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-01735 .

" Apple exec Eddy Cue testified that the volume of Google searches on Apple’s Safari web browser had declined for the first time in more than two decades . Cue attributed that declining volume to people using new AI-driven tools to find information . The bombshell comments drove Alphabet's stock price down as much as 9% in intraday trading .  Google says it is seeing increased use of new modes of searching, such as image searches with Google Lens or voice-based searches . The company also said investors were misinterprepreting the data, suggesting people are turning to Google’s Chrome or the Google app .  The total number of Google searches grew more than 20% year over year in 2024, the first full year that AI Overviews existed . But Google executive Sissie Hsiao said in April that since the debut of ChatGPT, Google had seen a decline in certain searches around “math and homework”  Google Search's global market share has declined since the debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late November 2022 . The decline in market share is the first time the company has dipped below 90% since 2015 . StatCounter's figures don’t directly assess traffic volumes of traditional search engines against usage of AI tools .  SimilarWeb, another web site tracking company, also shows a 2% decline in market share for Google year-over-year . Younger people are also increasingly searching on social media for product, travel, and restaurant recommendations .  In the first quarter, Google Search revenues grew 7% . But the growth of its “Google Search & Other” paid clicks had slowed to 2%, down from a 5% growth rate .  Google ad chief Srinivasan was pushing for the inclusion of ads in Gemini AI chatbot answers as soon as possible to compensate for generative AI tools’ eventual cannibalization of Google Search . “The writing is on the wall,” Srinavasan was quoted as saying in an October 2024 meeting .  Cue's testimony is a reminder that the clock is ticking . Cue says he's not sure how long it will take for him to find a solution to his dilemma .

You may find a reconciliation of GAAP financial measures that are included in our earnings release on our Investor Relations website . We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call .  We had a strong start to 2025. We achieved revenue of $479.1 million, up 20% year-over-year . We closed the quarter with 3,527 customers paying us more than $100,000 . Revenue contribution from these large customers now contribute 69% of revenue .  Cloudflare's gross margin was 77.1%, above our long-term target of 75% to 77%. We delivered operating profit of $56 million, representing an operating margin of 11.7% . We generated strong free cash flow of $52.9 million during the quarter .  This quarter, we landed the largest contract in Cloudflare's history, a milestone deal of more than $100 million . We continue to invest behind actual demand to not get too far over our skis and have robust and diversified supply chains to mitigate tariff and trade risks .  The short term may continue to be volatile in terms of external influences but the long term remains as full of opportunities for Cloudflare as ever .  A leading technology company signed a five-year $130 million pool of funds contracts, primarily for our workers' developer platform . This marks the largest deal in Cloudflare's history . The customer chose workers, durable objects, containers and our real-time products .  A large technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a two-year $9.4 million contract . An international critical infrastructure provider signed a seven-year, $12.7 million contract, marking our longest duration contract . And with the confidence of deals like this, our team is actively humming several more hundred million-dollar-plus deals .  A large US government entity signed a 2-year, $6.2 million contract for Zero Trust . Cloudflare has the broadest and most programmable cloud security and connectivity platform on the market .  A government agency in Asia Pacific signed a three-year, $4.8 million contract for Magic Transit and application services . Fortune 500 technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare .  Two products are just over a year old and have seen remarkable growth, the number of Cloudflare Workers AI inference request powered by our network are up nearly 4,000% year-over-year . We continue to invest in the future, building the first, fastest, and most powerful model context protocol or MCP server .  Cloudflare is building the interface for AI agents to work with their own platforms . These companies are choosing CloudFlare because we have a rich developer platform, but also because we combine it with an understanding of Internet performance and security .  Cloudflare delivered highest year-over-year growth in net new ACV in three years . Strength in our business this quarter was driven by large $1 million-plus customers, including our first contract of more than $100 million .  Total revenue for the first quarter increased 27% year-over-year to $479.1 million . US represented 49% of revenue, EMEA represented 28% and APAC represented 15% . We ended the quarter with 3,527 large customers .  First quarter gross margin was 77.1%, representing a decrease of 50 basis sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year . Recall that the first quarter of 2025 marks the first anniversary of the extension of the estimated useful life of our network equipment from four to five years .  Network CapEx represented 17% of revenue in the first quarter . Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3% year-over-year to 65% . Sales and marketing expenses were $183.4 million for the quarter .  Research and development expenses were $76.8 million in the quarter . R&D as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 16% compared to the same quarter last year . Operating income was $56 million, an increase of 32% year-over-year .  These unrealized losses primarily related to the remeasurement of our international operating lease liabilities are recognized in other income and expense . We ended the first quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities .  Free cash flow was $52.9 million in the quarter or 11% of revenue . Remaining performance obligations came in at $1.864 billion . Current RPO was 66% of total RPO, increasing 29% year-over-year .  For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $500 million to $501 million . We expect operating income for the full year to $62.5 million . And we expect an effective tax rate of 20%. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.18 .  We continue to focus on creating significant shareholder value with our ongoing commitment to disciplined execution, durable growth, and operational efficiency . I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as well as our customers for trusting us to help modernize, accelerate, and secure their businesses .  There hasn't been a change to what we see in terms of HCP requests, Matthew Prince said . Less of our business is sort of a pure media bit delivery business .  10 years ago, for every two pages, Google crawled, they send you one visitor . Six months ago, that was up to 6:1 . Now 75% of queries to Google, Google Answers on Google without sending you back to the original source .  The revenue beat was great to see. Margins were more or less in line with expectations . But the general trends across the Internet are traffic has remained the same. information. And we haven't seen anything that has caused us to believe that tariffs or anything else .  There is still more margin opportunity than there is a revenue opportunity, Matthew Hedberg said . We've done that in the first quarter especially investing in our go-to-market activities, and we are seeing good returns . The guidance will be moving forward as it has always been, the 40% rule .  Matthew Prince: We have been happy with improvements in sales productivity across the team . We're hiring dramatically across that or getting incredible candidates to join us. And I think the word is out that if you want to be at the next world-class sales organization, Cloudflare is the place to go .  Matthew Prince: DDoS attacks were up more than 300% year-over-year . Joel Fishbein: I think that will very much turn into sales going forward .  Cloudflare has always done it differently and took more engineering work, but it's showing in our ability to defend against attacks that others just can't . Most of our competitors run separate scrubbing networks that are completely distinct from the rest of their network . When you buy wholesale bandwidth, you pay for the greater capacity that is there .  DDoS attack pushes the in up, but even at hyperscale attacks, the in is not ever getting higher than the out . We are casting proxy. So we are out is always significantly higher than our in. of inverses out . And that architectural difference is radically different than what anyone else in the industry does .  Mark Murphy: We're seeing that a lot of the hyperscalers, some of our competitors are actually referring customers to us when they get to the point that their systems aren't able to stay in front of these attacks because they know that the architecture and design of our system is allowing us to mitigate what others can't .  Cloudflare is winning more of these larger deals than we've heard in the past . Matthew Prince: This is a market that we didn't start out in, but we realized our network could provide just a better experience . And again, that goes back to the fact that every server across our network can do everything. So if you're in Rwanda or if you are in Pakistan or you're anywhere in the world, we can actually deliver a SASE solution local to you that has just significantly better,  Cloudflare is unique in being able to deliver, both things like the DDoS mitigation mitigation, but then also SASE . And it all comes as one contiguous bundle . I think that really has stood out and caused us to win more and more of these deals .  As a follow-up, Matthew, I think you said you won a number of SASE deals with government agencies as well in both the US and APAC . And I'm wondering if you could just expand on the traction you're seeing in the broader government sector .  Cloudflare Workers has become a complete solution. We have all of the components, compute, storage, database, GPU capacity. And so as people are looking to decide whether they're going to go with a traditional hyperscaler, we're increasingly in the decision mix. And we're seeing places where people are realizing that they can develop significantly faster.  Cloudflare Workers can just get much better performance at a lower cost . They don't have to think about a number of things that even if you're using a hyperscaler, you still have to worry about . And so in this case, this was a customer that was well down the line with one of the traditional hyperscalers .  Cloudflare has built such a robust platform at this point that the people are saying, we're going to move off the true hyperscalers and move to CloudFlare because the ROI is just so much better . Keith Weiss: ""I've tried to caution that it was going to take probably a little bit longer for Workers to be delivering real revenue""  Matthew Prince: I don't think there's anything that really -- I'll start and then Thomas might say some more . My sense is mostly timing. I'm very excited that record $0.5 million, record quarter for $5 million add .  Thomas Seifert: We just see the investment in the go-to-market transition and transformation is just paying off . Even the two days missing played a role players. So a lot of small things coming together and impacting the count. But nothing that disturbs the long trend trajectory we see here .  Matthew Prince: We're not dependent on any network vendor we can buy from any of the big network vendors or we have our own white boxes that we can deliver. And that has allowed us to have a lot of flexibility. And then the existing treaties like NAFTA and otherwise allow us to do assembly of equipment in place .  Even using used equipment and moving that around is again, a very sophisticated way of us just making sure we can continue to invest in our network and build it out around the world . We are hearing from -- especially in the financial services and health care space that there is concern from -- if they're trying to use on-premise hardware from existing vendors .  Shaul Eyal: We're selling to larger customers, bigger deals, and you would naturally expect that, that would slow down sales cycles . That is not what we saw this quarter. I think that that's -- that's expected, and that's something that we can manage out .  Sales cycles have not picked up dramatically as deals have gotten bigger and customers have gotten more sophisticated, Mike Cikos said . I think that it's -- I think we will always outperform our peers. But I would expect the sales cycles will tick up slightly over time. I think it's the operational excellence that Mark and his team are driving across the entire sales team.  You guys obviously had a larger magnitude thinking about the 1Q top line beat . Can you just help us think a little bit more as far as the guidance construction here with the reiterated calendar '25 guide . How much of that is essentially incremental conservatism or prudence however you want to phrase it? Thomas Seifert .  Mark Anderson talked about the developer speed boat launching this year . He really came from the side of the developer platform and said -- I now feel like we've got the product nailed, let's go sell it. And she and the team there are being very deliberate and disciplined .  Adam Borg: ""I'm very excited with what we're seeing from the developer community. And we are much more active at pursuing large deals that can deliver real value,"" he said .  Anthropic put together a specification called model context protocol, MCP which is essentially an API to give a standard way for an AI system to be able to connect to a third-party service and interact with it in various ways .  There are massive security issues here. There will also be competing platforms. So Google has released an extension of MCP, which is slightly different. Our strategy is just to support everything. to be the universal translator that can make it so that you can connect to any service .  The killer app for Cloudflare Workers may be around the eye and the interconnection . 80% of the major AI companies are customers, and so much of the Internet uses it, says Jonathan Ho .  Matthew Prince says it was a difficult quarter in terms of the macro environment, but one that we executed in a way that I'm incredibly proud of . I know that it's going to be built on Cloudflare in our network and look forward to seeing you again this time next quarter .",neutral,"cloudflare, gaap, earnings, revenue, financial"

Today's discussion and our responses during the Q&A may include forward-looking statements . These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and reflect our views and assumptions as of the date such statements are made . If any of our beliefs or assumptions prove incorrect, actual financial results could differ .  Jeff Green is the co-founder and CEO of the company . Jeff Green: ""Despite increasing economic uncertainty, we showed incredible resilience, growing revenue 25% year over year, far surpassing our own expectations""  Today, I want to focus on just three topics . First, the macro environment; second, the open Internet and some of the significant changes and market shifts that have happened recently . And third, all of the upgrades we've made at TTD, including the latest updates to Kokai .  Programmatic advertising is extremely agile because our technology buys one impression at a time and evaluates every single impression, we can adjust quickly . We aim to be a source of vision and stability for our clients .  Headwinds have historically accelerated the move to programmatic because of its data, its control, its agility and of course, its performance . We did the same thing during the pandemic. While consumers stayed home to stay safe, they also accelerated their move to streaming .  The Trade Desk is pointed at the entire open Internet, and nearly all of global advertising will be transacted programmatically at end state . We are convinced that based on the current landscape and current competitive set, we are the best positioned to win the lion's share of market share .  Google has been declared an illegal monopoly in two separate instances in 2025 by the US courts .

US federal judge ruled that Spotify can have a payment relationship directly with the consumer that is not mediated via Apple . Google announced that it is not going to eradicate cookies from its market-leading Chrome browser .  Google's view of the world and vision for the future is getting closer and was validated once again . 2025 may have some macro headwinds, but the open Internet has never been in a better place than it is today .  Google is already beginning to turn down and turn off some of the draconian and illegal practices of the past . Google essentially acts as the defendant, the plaintiff, the judge, the jury, the court reporter and the bailer in many ad transactions .  Google should stop trying to monetize the open Internet and instead focus more on destinations . CTV and streamers have invested more into advertising . We're seeing more supply than demand in all forms of advertising, but that is especially especially especially in advertising .  CTV companies are once again leading the supply dynamics of the open Internet . They are plugging directly into our demand and describing their supply in greater detail than ever . Nearly every scaled player has adopted UID2 and those that have not are under monetizing their inventory .  OpenPath is gaining wider adoption across the industry . It provides publishers with a much clearer view of what advertisers are willing to pay . The open Internet monetizes movies, television, journalism, music and sports .  The New York Post saw its digital advertising fill rate increase more than 8x with Openpath . VIZIO sats programmatic revenue increased 39% with OpenPath . The Trade Desk doesn't expect OpenPath to be the only supply chain for us .  OpenPath is keeping exchanges and SSPs in check so that we don't have to wait on government to untangle corrupt practices like those recently exposed at Google . Another massive upgrade to improve the supply chain was the acquisition of Sincera .  The core of Kokai has been delivered and adoption is now ahead of schedule . Two-third of our clients are now using it and the bulk of the spend in our platform is now running through Kokai . We expect all clients to be using it by the end of the year .  Kokai combines client needs with strong point of view on where value is shifting and how to deliver the most efficient return on ad spend . We will introduce the final major components of Kokai, including a revolutionary new approach for understanding the performance of deals .  The injection of our industry-leading CoA AI tools across every aspect of our platform has been a game changer, and we are just getting started . Walled Garden Measurement may tell an advertiser, they've accounted for 1 million toothbrush sales this quarter, but they only actually sold 0.5 million .  Kokai is a way to unlock the full value and performance potential of the open Internet . Deutsche Telekom was able to use advanced AI tools in our Kokai platform to find new customers and define the right ad impressions across display and CTV .  Kokai is delivering on lower funnel KPIs, including 24% lower cost per conversion . Deutsche Telekom is now planning to use Kokai across more campaigns . Kokai has seen a 42% reduction in cost per unique reach .  Kokai used roughly 30% more data elements per impression. in our data marketplace to increase the discoverability of third-party data campaigns on Kokai . We simplified our go-to-market teams and their org structures. We've hired a new COO, Vivid Kandra. He joined the company as our new Chief Operating Officer.  The largest independent and objective DSP will command the lion's share of market share at end state . Today, we control less than 2% of the global advertising TAM, leaving us with an extraordinary runway for growth in front of us .  Trade Desk CEO: ""We have been winning in an unfair market -- we are even more confident we can win in a fair market"" ""This process has done a great deal to shine a light on the power of the open Internet,"" he says .  As I said, Kokai adoption now represents the majority of our spend, almost two-third, a significant acceleration from where we ended 2024 . We will continue to iterate and ship product every week. It's why we will never stop innovating.  The upgrades we made at the end of 2024 are beginning to deliver results, putting us in a better position to capture expanding market opportunities . Kokai adoption accelerated exiting December and our product and engineering teams are shipping -- growth remains strong .  Q1 revenue was $616 million, a 25% increase year over year . We generated $208 million of adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, representing a 34% margin . Our Sincera acquisition closed in Q1, and there is no revenue as a result of this acquisition .  International growth again outpaced North America for the ninth quarter in a row . Q1 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $433 million, up 23% from a year ago .  In Q1, we repurchased $386 million of our Class A common stock via our share repurchase program . DSO exiting the quarter were 85 days, down one day from a year ago . Income tax expense was $25 million for the first quarter, driven by our profitability and stock-based rents .  In Q2, we expect revenue to be at least $682 million, reflecting 17% year over year growth . We are encouraged by the strength of our underlying business, driven by continued progress on Kokai is our enhancements to our engineering and go-to-market teams and a growing pipeline of joint business plans .  We are confident in our ability to outpace the market and capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead . Our focus is on maintaining a balanced and efficient expense base, allowing us to stay agile and well positioned to capture share .  Q1 was a very strong quarter for us, and we showed our resilience. I think the team felt like they had something to prove, and I think we did it. I'm really proud of how well the team has executed. The upgrades that we made to our business did help contribute to our outperformance. They were not easy, but they definitely were worth it.  Two-third of our clients are now using Kokai, which is ahead of schedule . Kokai's delivering on lower funnel KPIs, including 24% lower cost per conversion and 20% lower price per acquisition .  The new reporting structures are working and they're leading to more engagement with brands and agencies . We still have work to do. We have not realized all the fruits of those upgrades . There's still more to come on that but trend line is awesome .  Operator Vasily Karasyov. Jeff, thank you very much for your comments regarding the guilty verdict and the Google trial . Jeff is very excited about our future and the opportunity to open Internet. even more excited about the opportunities ahead .  2025 has been a very rough year for Google, but even for walled gardens as a whole . Apple's decision to focus more on AI search engines rather than Google as a result of the remedy of that first trial is as significant as anything .  We think that this is a major victory for the open Internet. We think, again and again, we're seeing walled gardens and draconian tactics around auctions being put in check so that the market is more fair. And I don't believe there's any player that better represents the interest of the Open Internet and the Trade Desk . But thanks for the question.  Many large brands speaking to increased uncertainty in their reports . How do you think about that in your Q2 guidance? And how are you managing the business into the back half of the year? Jeffrey Green: I'm just really proud of our team's performance .  We think that for the rest of the year, our focus has to be on recognizing that large brands are facing comparatively tough times, and we need to be there to help them navigate that and be a source of strategic consulting for them . But of course, we have our eye on the horizon . We believe that we will grab land in the next year or accelerate growth and potentially both .  There's still a lot of exciting things coming out of Kokai. It seems that we continue to upgrade -- so there are a few major pieces left that we expect to ship in the very near future. So we're extremely excited about all the upgrades that are coming and all the things that we're building .  Jeff, Jeff, on Amazon, it's gotten a lot of attention recently, both in our investor meetings, but also in the press specifically around its DSP and the push into prime video ads . We believe at end state, the objective focused DSP will have the lion's share of market share, and we just got to keep executing .  The TAM is massive and there will be lots of players that I think have room to do well in this space . I think there's opportunity for a healthy competition, but I believe the objective DSP that aligns its interest with buyers will win the lion's share of market share .  Amazon is building this product to sell more prime video ads, not to be objective . Amazon is competing with Fortune 500 companies across food, retail, cloud, delivery and so many others . There's already a big concern about the amount of data that exists inside of AWS .  Prime Video will open up its inventory to additional demand because it's a little bit different than YouTube where there's so much supply and it's lower quality . Prime Video is obviously more professional content that might welcome additional demand .  Amazon's DSP at Amazon is focused on the open Internet, CEO says . He says content companies are leaning into partnerships with them in part because they know who we are and what we stand for, unlike those that are being more duplicitis .  Jeff Green: ""We think we'll earn it. We just have to keep executing"" Operator Jessica Reif Ehrlich: ""It's going to mostly be up to us and continuing to execute""  As a result of uncertainty, it's harder to want to commit to put dollars to work at a certain rate for the course of an entire year . So instead, what happens at the upfront is people go in with a commitment to try or to put money in a more agile setting, and there is nothing more than programmatic. So we anticipate that this upfront will be a little bit weaker for linear .  OpenPath is releasing a product called Deal desk that will lay groundwork for us to get more forward market like deals and create a lot more sophistication and performance out of upfronts or forward market than what currently exists in the upfronts .  The Arena group increased their fill rate by 4x and their revenue by 79% on Open Path . The New York Post increased its fill rates by 8x and its revenue by 97% . Spotify, FOX, FOX are integrating right now, and we have hundreds of others like Reuters, Washington Post, Dotdash Meredith .  We just need visibility from it so that we can make certain that we're steering the supply chain in the right way. We think we're in a better position to capitalize on a more efficient supply chain than we ever had in the past .  Jeff, the first question, I appreciate the commentary on the Amazon competition. I did want to ask you about DV360 because it does seem like they continue to invest in that product with more retail media functionality and things like that . I guess do you see like a byproduct of the DOJ suit being Google kind of stepping on the gas on the DSP side maybe? Or just would love to get your thoughts there. Laura, the sequential decline was a lot better than what we typically see in Q1.  The cost of goods sold in YouTube is close to zero. -- it's an amazing asset for them. But it's not the open Internet. And it certainly -- they're not in a position to objectively buy the rest of the open .  Q4 to Q1 sequential strength was driven by political simply because we exited presidential cycle in the US, entered 2025 when we're not in an off-cycle and don't have much contribution . So it's more just strength in the changes we're making to the business, Mark. there's a to end up and then we'll monetize the open Internet, and they will monetize YouTube. I think that's almost what it is already, to your point, Laura.",neutral,"earnings, profitability, strategic, business, outperformance"

In the first quarter, $61.6 billion of its $80.5 billion in revenue came from advertising-related sources . The market views this as a potential liability, as advertising budgets tend to get cut during an economic downturn . Still, Alphabet's situation is hardly different from that of Apple, as Apple relies on sales of consumer electronics .  Apple is just as vulnerable to a downturn as Alphabet, so its premium doesn't make a ton of sense .

" The US government has ruled that Google has an illegal monopoly in its search engine, online advertising and app store . Google is fighting to overturn those decisions, which could force the nearly $2 trillion company to split up .  Google's search engine took off in the late 1990s and early 2000s because it had a novel way of ranking results:by importance,based on how often other sites linked to them, shedding light on which websites had more credibility and relevance . Today, Google is much more than a search engine, it is at the helm of the most popular corners of the internet .  Google inked contracts worthtens of billions of dollars to make it the default search provider on iPhones . A judge deemed those deals anticompetitive, calling Google a “monopolist” in online search . DOJ now wants Google to either spin off or make major changes to its Chrome browser and Android operating system . Google has said it plans to appeal the case .  Google argued that the DOJ’s proposal would pose security risks and harm Chrome . It is instead proposing amending its browser agreements to allow companies to switch their default browser provider every 12 months . Google also developed a technology “stack” that enabled brands to buy online ads .  In April, a judge ruled that Google was able to “establish and protect its monopoly power” by tying its ad server and publisher exchange together . The DOJ is pushing for Google to sell two parts of its ad businesses to restore competition . Google is appealing that case, which could force it to divest part of its online advertising business .  The legal stakes are especially high for Google amid predictions that AI tools will take over some of the functions of search engines .

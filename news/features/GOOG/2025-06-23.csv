" Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, TSMC, and ASML are all strong plays on expanding AI infrastructure . Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are three tech titans set to benefit from AI . Palantir and Salesforce are two leading software companies that have big AI opportunities ahead .  AMD has become a leader in central processing units (CPUs), which act as the brains of the operation, within the data center . The company has also carved out a niche for its GPUs with AI inference, which is less technically demanding than training AI models .  Broadcom sees its three furthest-along customers as having between a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market in fiscal 2027 . This is a huge opportunity for Broadcom . While the above three companies design advanced AI chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSMC)is the one they hire to actually make them .  ASML has a virtual monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography . It also introduced its next-generation technology, high-NA (numerical aperture) EUV, that will allow for higher density chips . While TSMC has balked at the high price ($400 million) of these new machines, it cannot afford to get bypassed on the technological front by a competitor likeIntel .  Amazon is using AI throughout its e-commerce operations to make its business more efficient and reduce costs . Meta Platforms has been at the forefront of AI with its Llama large language model (LLM) Meta platforms are using AI to keep users more engaged on its social media apps .  Palantir Technologies has taken a different approach to AI, essentially looking to become the orchestration layer, or operating system, for the technology . It does this by gathering data from a wide array of sources and structuring it into an ontology that connects digital assets with their real-world counterparts . This then allows its customers to use its platform to solve complex problems through the use of AI .  Salesforce is now looking to become the leader in agentic AI, where AI agents will go out and perform tasks with little to no human interaction . As a consumption-based solution, AI agents are a huge opportunity for the company .  The Motley Fool is issuing “Double Down’s alerts for three incredible companies .

" ChatGPT developer OpenAI has been at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution for more than two years . Teaming up with OpenAI could be a transformative move for Alphabet as its core search business continues to face pressure .  Microsoft's investment in OpenAI wasn't just about raising capital . As part of their partnership, OpenAI became tightly integrated into Microsoft's cloud service, Azure . Recent moves from ChatGPT maker suggest it's looking to avoid vendor lock-in with Microsoft .  Working with OpenAI may look odd from the outside as the platform could be seen as both a technical competitor and existential threat to Google's search business . However, I think there is a more interesting aspect to this relationship whereby Alphabet is hedging the economic profiles of its various platforms .  In a scenario where OpenAI and its peers begin to erode Google search -- thereby taking a toll on Alphabet's advertising revenue -- Alphabet is still able to capture some downstream monetization . Alphabet's cloud infrastructure business captures revenue that is otherwise lost from the consumer-facing advertising segment of Google search .  Alphabet trades at a considerable discount compared to its cloud hyperscaler peers on a forward earnings basis . Some investors may be of the opinion that Alphabet entered the cloud computing race far too late and will never catch up to Amazon or Microsoft . The irony from Alphabet's deal with OpenAI is that the company might actually have unlocked a backdoor channel to continue thriving even as its core search business faces mounting pressure .  The Motley Fool’s total average return is994% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to172% for the S&P 500 . Don’t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you joinStock Advisor .

" US-China trade thaw hasn't shaken Wall Street's biggest bear . ""We continue to see a recession as our base case,"" says BCA Research chief strategist Peter Berezin . Berezin gained attention for being the lone bear on Wall Street coming into 2025 .  Berezin took his recession probability odds down to 60% from 75% in his latest note . He reiterated a call for the S&P 500 to plunge 25% from current levels to end 2025 at 4,450 . Berezin: ""We would assign 30% odds to a major fiscal crisis this year""  The S&P 500 reversed its losses on the year on Tuesday but gave back some gains on Wednesday .

" Google has terminated 15,876 YouTube channels in the first three months of this year . The move is part of an ongoing investigation into coordinated influence operations linked to China . Google has been tackling Chinese influence operations that focus on creating news channels and blogs, which seek to appear legit .  In 2022, Google removed more than 50,000 China-based YouTube channels for this reason, and another 65,000 channels in 2023 . But then,in among these inconspicuous updates, these channels will also amplify pro-China messaging, with a view to shifting viewer opinions .  TikTok hasn’t reported such in its own threat reports, but I think it’s safe to assume that this would have been highlighted to U.S. senators in the top secret security briefings they attended in the lead-up tovoting in the TikTok sell-off bill . Google also removed 4282 YouTube channels linked to similar initiatives originating from Russia .  U.S. consulting firm initiating coordinated information campaigns sounds very Cambridge Analytica-like . China remains by far the top source of such activity, with ongoing initiatives that seek to sway Western user opinions via social media-based influence efforts .",negative,"youtube, google, channels, china, chinese"

" Apple (AAPL) faced Epic Games in a landmark court case in 2021 . Apple was ordered to let developers inform users about payment methods outside its app store . Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers dramatically escalated the ongoing legal battle between Apple and Epic Games .  Judge Rogers ruled Apple's response to the injunction as deliberately anticompetitive . Apple had secretly imposed a 27% fee on transactions conducted through external links, barely lower than their usual commission . Rogers referred both Apple and Alex Roman to federal prosecutors for potential criminal contempt charges .  Apple filed an emergency appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court, arguing that compliance with the injunction would cause significant financial harm . Apple claimed that allowing unrestricted external payment methods could cost the company billions in annual revenue, severely undermining its App Store business model . Judge Rogers refused to delay enforcing her order, emphasizing Apple’s repeated delays and clear non-compliance . Legal analysts predict that Apple faces significant hurdles in its appeal due to the abundance of evidence presented against it .  Epic Games submitted Fortnite for review, aiming to resume availability on iPhones and iPads . Apple's compliance remains uncertain, as the injunction does not explicitly force Apple to restore Epic’s developer account or immediately approve the fan-favorite game . The outcome of this conflict extends far beyond Apple and Epic Games .  The ruling aligns with new regulations such as the European Digital Markets Act . The U.S. Department of Justice has its own antitrust case against Apple . The ruling energized a coalition of developers and companies, including Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Match (MTCH)  On Wall Street, Apple carries a Moderate Buy rating with 17 Buys, eight Holds, and four Sells over the past three months . Despite the ongoing legal squabble, Apple stock remains resilient .  The potential financial repercussions for Apple are substantial, with billions of dollars in annual revenue potentially at risk .

" The Justice Department’s principal antitrust division deputy, Roger Alford, said the new administration is going to aggressively pursue illegal competition . The approach is already evident in a number of antitrust enforcement cases targeting Big Tech companies .  The FTC is also asking for D.C. federal district court judge James Boasbergin a separate antitrust trial to force Meta to sell off Instagram as well as WhatsApp . Many of these cases started during the first Trump administration, where Alford also worked .  The DOJ is also working to prevent harmful monopoly conduct before it happens, Alford said . One way is by adopting more flexible merger review standards . Consent decrees with merging parties that put antitrust concerns at bay, he said .  There’s a need to update “a whole variety” of ambiguous antitrust laws, he said . The administration's philosophy is that it can best promote US competition and innovation by focusing on unfair competition in industries that the public cares about .

" Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said strong competition laws would help increase innovation and help grow the economy . The think tank said the Government should give more powers to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to challenge the dominance of Apple and Google .

" The S&P 500 is less than 1% away from returning to positive territory for the year . The most important companies in the major indexes continued to perform well last quarter .  There's no perfect science for knowing when a sell-off is about to start nor for gauging when one is over . But there are some simple indicators you can use to gauge market sentiment . Growth-focused and cyclical sectors like tech, consumer discretionary, communications, and financials tend to do well .  Another good indicator to watch is the CBOE Volatility Index, commonly known as the VIX . The VIX was at its lowest point of the year when the S&P 500 was near its all-time high in late February . Then, shortly after President Trump unveiled his global tariffs on April 2, VIX spiked in lockstep with a massive sell-off . In the last few weeks, the Vix has been falling and the S.P 500 has been climbing, a combination that could signal that the worst of the sell off is over .  The steep tariffs that Trump imposed led to a host of countries imposing their own higher tariffs on U.S. exports . Corporate leaders didn't shy away from outlining the effects these tariffs would have on their businesses . It also shows the degree to which the market despises uncertainty .  Several companies saw their stock prices get crushed for the wrong reasons . Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and American Express are examples of companies that were doing just fine even when trade war tensions were hot .  Investors can take a similar approach by not overhauling their investment portfolios based on factors that don't pertain to the underlying investment theses of their holdings . Accept that rough conditions can get worse before they get better . The same approach applies when the market is going up .  Stock Advisor’s total average return is 948% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to170% for the S&P 500 .

" Google Parent Alphabet(GOOGL) faced a day of reckoning in April when the U.S. Department of Justice prevailed in a landmark case against it .

Y Combinator has helped seed many of the sector’s most promising new companies, including Airbnb, Instacart, and Stripe . Founded in 2005 by tech industry leaders such as Paul Graham, Jessica Livingstone, and Trevor Blackwell . In itsamicus brieffiled on May 9, a legal document filed by a third party with no direct involvement in the court case, the startup accelerator laid out the problems it sees with Google's operations .  VC firms have become reluctant to fund startups in the AI and digital search spaces, due to perceived risk of Google strangling new and early-stage companies in these fields . Y Combinator also notes that in the current age of innovation, simply developing a new product is no longer enough .  Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan says the company isn't calling for a breakup of Google . The startup accelerator believes a more level playing field is essential for new companies entering the tech field . This comes at an especially critical time, as more and more entrepreneurs look to break into the fast-growing areas such as AI, machine learning, and other areas that could fall within the parameters of the “kill zone” noted by the accelerator .  YC says effective antitrust remedies in this case will be critical for startups currently trying to attract venture capital, reach users, and gain scale .

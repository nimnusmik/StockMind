" The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has driven stock market gains over the past couple of years . Analysts predict an AI market of more than $2 trillion by the early 2030s . Laffont, as founder of Coatue Management, oversees a $22.6 billion portfolio .  Coatue founder Laffont sold some shares of top AI chip designer Nvidia .

The biggest positions in Coatue's $22.6 billion portfolio are Meta andAmazon, each with weightings of more than 9%.

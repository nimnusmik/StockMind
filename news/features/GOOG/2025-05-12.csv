Shares of parent company Alphabet fell 8% on Wednesday after this possibility was revealed . Interested investors worried about Apple's growing interest in AI competition might want to use this setback as an opportunity to buy Alphabet stock .  Apple's services chief Eddy Cue commented on Wednesday that he believes artificial intelligence-powered web search tools like OpenAI or Perplexity will eventually be added to the list of search engines made available to users of Apple's proprietary web browser, Safari .

Alphabet could be poised for future growth with its investments in AI and other emerging technologies .  Alphabet conducted a 20-for-1 stock split on July 15, 2022, meaning investors received 20 shares for every one share they owned . Before the split, Alphabet was trading at $2,255 . Afterward, it traded at a split-adjusted price of about $113, making it a far more budget-friendly investment .  Alphabet made $90.2 billion in revenue in the first quarter, a 12% increase year over year . Alphabet owns YouTube, which captured 12% of overall TV viewing, according to Nielsen data .

" The long-term investing thesis for Amazon remains as strong as it was when the stock was hitting all-time highs . Google parent Alphabet faces big challenges, but it should also continue to be a big winner . The Trade Desk is still the leader in a market with huge growth potential .  Amazon's shares are 22% below the high from earlier this year at the time of this writing . This sell-off is due to concerns about the negative impacts oftariffs . I suspect Amazon's business could hold up better than many expect . Exorbitant tariff levels will almost certainly be temporary .  Amazon remains as solid as it was when its share price was hitting all-time highs just a few months ago . E-commerce still has a lot of room to expand. Organizations will continue shifting their IT spending to the cloud. Artificial intelligence (AI) will remain a massive tailwind. Amazon is poised to benefit from all these trends .  The antitrust rulings could cause major headaches for Google . But I wouldn't get the cart before the horse: Alphabet just might come out in better shape than expected . Betting against Google in search or AI is ill-advised in my view .  The Trade Desk's share price has cratered this year . The adtech stock is down almost 60% from its record high hit in the fourth quarter of 2024 . But don't play a funeral dirge for this one-time highflier . I think the Trade Desk could be like the mythical phoenix rising from the ashes .  This adtech stock's crisis presents a great opportunity for long-term investors . If my answers to these questions are right, buying The Trade Desk now should pay off handsomely over the coming years .

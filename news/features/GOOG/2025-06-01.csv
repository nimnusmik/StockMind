" The stock market's crazy first five months of 2025 have left Wall Street pros in a pickle . The benchmark is basically flat for 2025 and putting up one of its worst starts to a year since the 1950s . It's also getting handily beaten by stock markets around the world .  Over the past 30 years, the S&P’s average return is roughly flat for June, as much of Wall Street begins its summer holiday season . Corporate executives are as pessimistic as they’ve been since 2022, according to a recent CEO confidence survey .  The S&P 500’s 19% plunge from its Feb. 19 record pushed it into a correction in just 16 trading days and brought it to the brink of a bear market . But after its almost 19% rebound since then, equity valuations have gotten much more stretched . US stocks are trailing the MSCI All Country World Index excluding the US Index by 12 percentage points in 2025 .  Historically, the third year of a US bull market, like now, is the weakest . Since World War II, the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of just 5.2% in year three . Since 1947, bull markets have averaged 55 months .  The market’s best performing sector this year is industrials, an optimistic sign for shares and growth . Defensive plays like utilities and consumer staples companies are also atop the leader board . Consumer discretionary shares that house some of the biggest retailers, homebuilders and automakers are among the worst performers this year .  In post-US presidential election years over the past seven decades, the S&P 500 has struggled in early June as investors booked profits heading into the summer . This is particularly true if the index gets a strong boost in May, like it did this year with a 6.2% jump .",negative,"markets, stocks, 2025, stock, market"
" Germany is reportedly contemplating imposing a 10% tax on major online platforms, including Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. Wolfram Weimer, the new German Minister of State for Culture, disclosed this proposal in an interview with Stern magazine . President Donald Trump has previously expressed his disapproval of foreign governments taxing American companies .  Weimer suggested that these companies generate billions in profits in Germany, contribute minimally to the country’s tax base and society . He also criticized the monopolistic tendencies of these digital platforms, arguing that they pose a threat to freedom of expression .  The shares of Alphabet fell 0.24% to close at $172.96 on Thursday, meanwhile Meta rose 0.23% to $645.05 . If the German government proceeds with this tax, it would join Britain, Italy, France, Spain, Turkey, India, Austria, and Canada, which have imposed similar taxes .  On Thursday, the company announced its first day of trading in the U.S. stock market . The company is expected to release a full range of new products on Thursday .",neutral,"tax, taxes, german, germany, austria"

" Federal judge who will decide how to limit Google’s monopoly in search is considering its advantage in artificial intelligence . Judge Amit Mehta aims to minimize harm to the other players in the market with any resolution . It will be up to MehtA to decide whether to break up the company and reshape the internet .  The government has asked Mehta to ban Google from paying for search engine defaults . It also wants Google to sell its Chrome web browser and share some of the data it collects to create its search results .  Questions focused on Justice Department's proposal for forward-looking, long-term measures to reform Google . Antitrust regulators have argued that Google’s dominance in traditional search could extend to generative AI, which is becoming a key gateway for how users access information online . Google's counterproposal would allow that opportunity to occur .  DOJ says cutting off Google's payments to Apple, Mozilla and others to distribute its search engine would cause widespread market harm . Mehta: ""Every single distribution partner said, ‘This would harm us’ still allow for the company to split revenue with competing browsers .  Google argues that it is the market leader in search because of more than 20 years of innovation . The government's proposals would hurt American consumers and the economy, Google argues . The company's lead lawyer John Schmidtlein objected to any payment ban .  Mehta appeared skeptical of Google's argument for more limited remedies, indicating he is considering including AI-related measures in his decision . Schmidtlein countered that gen AI products are not in the relevant market for search . AI chatbots are already seen as an existential threat to traditional search engines .  AI-drafted responses replacing the need to present people with a long list of search results pointing across the web . As the trial unfolded in April and May, some representatives from AI companies told the court they are already being stymied by Google .  Chrome is a significant part of Google's search business, a DOJ lawyer says . The judge's questions about the remedy suggested concern about whether the divestiture would actually achieve its intended competitive benefits . Representatives of two prominent AI startups testified during the trial that their companies would be interested in buying Chrome if Google forced to divest it .  Google argued that any divested Chrome would be “a shadow of the current Chrome’s current Chrome,” harming competition instead of helping it . Google would be barred from paying for placement on Chrome again if the payment ban was lifted .  Dahlquist said he is “not looking to kneecap Google” but to bolster potential competitors . “We are trying to kickstart competitors, we are not trying to put them on equal footing on day one.”",neutral,"antitrust, google, monopoly, search, competitors"

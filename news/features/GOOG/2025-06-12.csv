" Investors are looking for a win that can help repair the brand damage and shift Tesla back into growth mode . Musk said Tesla would start the new self-driving car service in Austin as soon as June 22 .

The rules governing driverless vehicles in Texas are notably light . Texas is popular choice for companies in early stages of autonomous service .  Tesla has embraced a different approach to autonomy, favoring a camera-only system rather than a combination of lidar, radar and pre-mapping that competitors use . Musk has long claimed such an approach will allow the company to scale up sooner than rivals including Waymo, which he considers too expensive .  Tesla has been in touch with Austin city officials and first responders to discuss safety expectations . The company has said robotaxis will be remotely monitored initially . Last week, Waymo drove into a flooded area following a storm .  Elon Musk's public spat with President Trump threatens to alienate even more customers .

Robotaxis aren't an optional extra for the car industry; they are the future of mobility .  Leading technology companies have invested billions in robotaxis and autonomous driving . Autonomous driving and robotaxis are an integral part of the future of the auto industry . Automakers need to offer robotaxis to make mobility more affordable .  Tesla's advantage in scaling robotaxis lies in its ability to transform existing Tesla vehicles into robotaxis, as well as its capability to produce a dedicated robotaxi, the Cybercab . Unlike Waymo, Tesla doesn't need to partner with automakers to build scale .  Ford is a long way from having a profitable EV business . Tesla generated $7.1 billion in operating profit in 2024 . Ford sold 22,550 EVs in the first quarter, implying it lost almost $38,000 on every EV sold . Despite losing market share amid declining sales, Tesla still dominated the U.S. market .  Ford backed off its robotaxi plans in 2022, following the shutdown of Argo AI by Ford andVolkswagenafter years of heavy investment .

" AppLovin is a premier mobile technology company that has transitioned from a mobile gaming developer to a full-fledged app marketing and monetization platform . It was established in 2012 and is based in Palo Alto, California . The company operates two main business units: Software Platform and Apps .  The AXON platform is powered by AppLovin's sophisticated machine learning infrastructure, which is its own product . The proprietary AI engine that the company uses, being at the heart of the whole process, is in charge of the incredible computational task of processing a diverse range of data to make real-time decisions .  The platform's establishment to process and learn from billions of pieces of data each day creates a significant barrier for other competitors . AXON is the neural network that drives the whole platform with deep learning technology . AppLovin has the technology stack including high-performance real-time bidding (RTB) infrastructure .  Applovin is a low-latency system for mobile advertising where split-second decisions are the determinants of campaign success . The programmatic advertising technology platform includes header bidding alongside the integration allowing publishers to increase their revenue through enabling multi-demand sources to compete for the same inventory simultaneously .  AppLovin's analytics tool provides sophisticated analysis of cohorts, predicting lifetime value, and churn modeling to the app developers in an effort to enhance the user acquisition process . The platform's ability to connect the costs of acquiring new users with the value they bring over time means it can help optimize return .  AppLovin is up against robust competition from technology companies that are using their resources and networks . Google, through its AdMob platform and Google Ads ecosystem, is probably the strongest rival . Facebook's Audience Network and vast amount of data from social media makes it possible for precise user targeting .  The way to deal with this threat is a concentration on those areas where the giants might not be as swift or/and comprehensive . Apple's recent privacy policies, namely, App Tracking Transparency (ATT), are a mixed-source benefit in the competition scene .  The mobile advertising game is competitive with the participation of many niche players . Unity Technologies uses its Unity Ads platform to operate in the same arena as mobile gaming ads . Chartboost has a very specific operation model that enables it to focus only on mobile game advertising .  AppLovin's user acquisition, monetization, and analytics in one solution platform delivers accessibility and effectiveness . Strengthened by the right acquisitions, the company is in a stronger position as it has consolidated its market share, and the potential competition was eliminated .  AppLovin is at a high risk concerning the technological factors stemming from its reliance on mobile platforms governed by Apple and Google . The prospective platform issues may involve more rigorous SDK approval processes, more privacy restrictions, or modified app store policies . The introduction of Private Relay in iOS 17 and the addition of enhanced tracking protection greatly narrow data collection capabilities .  AXON's machine learning algorithms are the backbone of AppLovin's business edge as they grant a strongly concentrated technical risk around model performance and accuracy . The susceptibility of machine learning models to concept drift, where changing user behavior patterns or market conditions reduce the effectiveness of the model over time, is one of the most common reasons for this fall .  The scale at which AppLovin is processing data, daily handling over billions of events, is making it more difficult to ensure comprehensive data validation while maintaining the real-time processing needs . Attacks that are deceitful to the machine learning systems could influence either the bidding algorithms or the attribution models, which will in turn lead to financial losses and site degradation .  The high focus on the gaming vertical that has led to a competitive advantage could be detrimental if the gaming industry undergoes a drastic change . The forward P/E ratios for AppLovin portray impressive earnings acceleration . The company's PEG ratios of 0.94 (non-GAAP forward) and 0.31 (GAAP TTM) are at a high level with respect to the growth rates .  AppLovin is off the charts due to its markdown price based on its growth potential . Adobe (1.35) and Cadence (3.09) declare lesser P/E compression over time, while Applovin shows signs of higher earnings growth . Guru Holdings Lowenstein's 17.19% stake which is equivalent to $762.85 million shows tremendous conviction .  Resnick's 13.47% stake ($740.26M) with an average cost basis of $49.41 (695.4% gain) represents even earlier conviction in AppLovin's transformation story . Lowenstein's 0% recent change indicates dissatisfaction with current positioning while maintaining long-term conviction .  AppLovin focuses on mobile gaming and app monetization areas . The AXON platform's automatic algorithms for the mobile app environment often result in better performance than generic ad solvers .",neutral,"apps, app, applovin, ios, axon"

" The big winner of the first phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has clearly been Nvidia . As competition heats up in the AI chips market, cloud services providers could benefit . As the AI revolution rolls on, other companies may supplant Nvidia .  In 2022, Nvidia generated about $27 billion in revenue . As of its most recent quarter, the company reported $130 billion . That's shockingly fast growth, and it's often cited for why Nvidia's share price has risen 800% .  As the market for AI chips becomes more saturated, who will benefit? My investing instincts point to one of the big buyers of AI chips . Amazon, through its Amazon Web Services division, controls around 30% of the cloud services market . Amazon's market share is roughly equal to Microsoft's combined AI chip market share .  Next phase of AI revolution could see the focus shift away from AI infrastructure (GPUs) and toward practical AI . Amazon stock, with its leading position in that key market, could ultimately outperform Nvidia stock in the long term . The cloud infrastructure market is enormous (ataround $700 billion) and red-hot, growing at around 15% year over year .

While Broadcom is seeing strong growth from its networking portfolio, its biggest opportunity lies in helping customers develop custom AI chips .

While some see AI as a risk, more likely than not, it will be a growth driver for the company .Pinterest has spent the last few years investing heavily to help transform its platform into one that is both more engaging and shoppable .  Philip Morris International is being led by its portfolio of smokeless products that includes the nicotine pouch Zyn and premium heated tobacco product Iqos .

" Do you receive login security codes for your online accounts via text message? These are the six- or seven-digit numbers sent via SMS that you need to enter along with your password . This type of security is known as multifactor authentication (MFA) and is designed to keep your account secure .  Some of the most prominent tech companies recommending that users enable multifactor authentication have used third-party companies to send their security codes to users via text . Some of these companies have been linked to institutions in the surveillance industry and even government spy agencies .  The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a warning in December urging people to migrate away from receiving security codes via text . But this vulnerability in texted security codes doesn’t mean you should revert to using merely a password to access your accounts .  An authenticator app is an application that stores security codes for your multifactor authentication accounts . The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency now warns against sending security codes via text message . Authentator app codes can never be intercepted in transit, because they are never sent to you .  Authentator apps are vastly more secure than text messages for getting your security codes . The safest login method no longer relies on codes or passwords . Passkeys are cryptographically complex but easy to use from a consumer perspective .  Passkeys can’t be phished or guessed . If one of your passkeys were stolen and put on someone else’s device, it wouldn't work either . Passkeys are synced to the cloud if you lose your device .

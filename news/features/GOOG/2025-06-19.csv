" Warren Buffett's simple investing strategy has steered Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating returns for six decades . Buffett rarely invests in tech stocks, but he has made some exceptions for quality names like Apple and Amazon . There is another tech giant ticking almost all of Buffett's boxes right now, and it's a clear leader in the AI industry .  Buffett likes to buy good companies when they are trading cheap, but he doesn't shy away from picking up spectacular companies at a fair price . Buffett has expressed regret for not investing in AI stock during its early years .  Buffett oversees numerous wholly owned Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries, including Duracell, Dairy Queen, and GEICO Insurance . He generally avoids technology stocks like those in the ""Magnificent Seven,"" but he has made exceptions . Between 2016 and 2023, Buffett plowed approximately $38 billion intoApple .  Apple repurchased more than $100 billion worth of its own stock in the past year alone . Amazon isn't the perfect Buffett stock because the company doesn't pay a dividend . Berkshire Hathaway also has a small $2.1 billion position in Amazon .  Alphabet is cheaper than the broader market based on the 23.7 P/E ratio of the S&P 500 index . Over the last four quarters alone, it distributed $9.8 billion in dividends and completed more than $61 billion worth of share buybacks . Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are still on Alphabet's board .  The U.S. Department of Justice recently won a court case against Google over its anticompetitive behavior . The judge in the case has yet to hand down his ruling on penalties and remedies . Any result that erodes Google's 89.5% market share in the internet search industry could deal a blow to Alphabet's financial results .  Alphabet is combating this threat with AI-generated answers that appear above the traditional results in Google Search . The company hopes this will stop users from abandoning its search engine in favor of chatbots . However, Alphabet hedged its bets by launching its own AI assistant, Gemini .  The Motley Fool’s total average return is791% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to174% for the S&P 500 .

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang encapsulated a seismic shift in technology with a statement .  Nvidia has become synonymous with the AI revolution, powering advancements in everything from autonomous vehicles to scientific research . Huang: “We need 30, 40 times more performance because the reasoning models are talking to themselves. Instead of one-shot ChatGPT, it's now a reasoning model, and it generates a ton more tokens” Huang continued, “Those thinking models, reasoning models achieve incredible performance, but they require a lot more computational capability.”  Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips represent a leap in computational performance, specifically designed to meet the demands of next-generation AI models . The Blackwell architecture enables unprecedented speed and efficiency, supporting the complex reasoning and multi-step problem-solving capabilities that define modern AI systems .  Huang’s statement centers on the rise of “reasoning models” in AI . These advanced systems go beyond simple input-output tasks to engage in processes akin to logical deduction, planning, and self-reflection . Unlike traditional language models, these advanced systems can break down problems, explore multiple solutions, and even critique their own outputs .  Huang’s assertion that our relationship with computers will fundamentally change is not just a prediction — it is a roadmap shaped by his decades of leadership and technical expertise . In a world where AI is reshaping industries and daily life, Huang's vision serves as both a reflection of current trends and a guide for the future .",neutral,"ai, nvidia, computational, architecture, advancements"

" Thomas Wolf, co-founder and chief science officer at Hugging Face, has cast doubt on the belief that current artificial intelligence systems will lead to major scientific breakthroughs . Wolf toldFortunethat today's large language models, or LLMs, excel at providing answers but fall short when it comes to formulating original questions .  Wolf said he initially found the post compelling but became skeptical after rereading it again . Wolf argues that today’s AI systems are built to predict likely outcomes, act as ""yes-men on servers,"" capable of mimicking human responses but incapable of challenging assumptions or generating original ideas .  Wolf also questioned how AI performance is measured today . Wolf cited that real scientific progress often comes from paradigm shifts . He argued that AI needs to demonstrate the ability to challenge its training data .  Hugging Face is a prominent open-source platform in the AI community . Wolf said the landmark victory of DeepMind's AlphaGo over world champions made headlines but was not revolutionary . Wolf concluded that while current models are useful as assistants, scientific progress requires a different kind of intelligence .

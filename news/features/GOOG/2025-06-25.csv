" Alphabet kicked off the quantum computing investment hype in December . IonQ's platform offers several key advantages over some of its competitors . Companies are racing to build their best platform, which is no small task .  Willow's Willow quantum computing chip completed a five-minute task that would have taken 10 septillion years (10 to the 25th power) to complete . This computation is only possible using quantum computing . Quantum computingdiffers from traditional computing because it uses qubits instead of bits .  Every qubit in IonQ's quantum computing system is connected to every other qubit . This allows them to achieve a 99.9% or greater two-qubit gate fidelity . While most companies are supercooling their systems to almost absolute zero . This is a key factor when deploying quantum computing solutions, as cooling ions to that temperature is expensive .  Quantum computing has huge implications across many industries, most notably in logistics and AI, but there could be further use cases discovered as quantum computing proliferates . The next few years will reveal a great deal about the quantum computing race and which companies will emerge as leaders and losers .  IonQ is an all-or-nothing bet on quantum computing, and if it fails, the stock will become worthless . There's also a chance that the approach these two are taking will flop, which could cause their stocks to suffer . Alphabet, of course, still has its legacy advertising business to lean on .

" AppLovin has gone from a relatively unknown ad-tech solution provider to a $110 billion mobile marketing powerhouse in less than three years . Its pivot away from first-party games and toward a pure platform model has sharpened margins and heightened market attention .  In 2024, the Software Platform (Advertising) segment contributed about 68% of revenue, while the Apps (gaming) segment was 32% . However, advertising revenue grew 75% year-over-year (YoY) in 2024, whereas Apps revenue grew only 3% . AppLovin announced an agreement to sell its mobile gaming portfolio to Tripledot Studios for roughly $400 million in cash .  At its core, AppLovin offers an end-to-end software platform that helps app developers acquire users and monetize their apps . The sale also eliminates any conflict of interest with its clients (third-party app developers)  AppLovin historically operated its own games and, critically, owns the mediation layer (MAX), it enjoys a rich stream of first-party data with every ad impression and user action . MAX allows multiple networks to bid in real time for each ad impression, unlike the old waterfall systems . Developers prefer MAX because it yields higher fill rates and revenue .  AppLovin can find and convert users at a lower cost than rivals . Management noted that post-sale, some of the $1.5 billion of TTM Apps revenue will effectively be replaced by additional Advertising revenue (Tripledot becoming a client)  AppLovin invested in Connected TV (CTV) advertising through its Wurl subsidiary . The retail media space and OEM partnerships are also on the radar . Profit margins will improve dramatically with the low-margin gaming operations gone .  43% of AppLovin's revenue already comes from outside the U.S. There is still room to grow internationally in regions like Latin America, the Middle East, and India as smartphone usage and app economies expand .  In 2024, Unity's total revenue (including its Create segment for engine licenses) was $1.8 billion (actually down 17% from 2023) Unity remains unprofitable (a net loss of $664 million in 2024) By contrast, AppLovin's 2024 revenue was $4.7 billion (growing 43% YoY) In the pure ads business, it likely generated well over 3x the revenue of Unity's ads division .  AppLovin has started encroaching on Digital Turbine's turf with its Array initiative, partnering with OEMs/carriers to get apps recommended or pre-installed on devices . Unity rejected its bid to acquire Unity and instead proceeded to merge with ironSource .  AppLovin's advantage is in-app contextual and behavioral data at scale within its network, plus the mediation control . The company provides advertiser access to roughly1.6 billion daily active users .  AppLovin has played on both sides (advertiser acquisition and publisher monetization) to entrench itself . A competing platform would need to show materially better results to convince developers to switch .  AppLovin's vertical integration was once questioned (running its own games was seen as a conflict) Now that it's a pure platform, the trust with third-party developers should only increase, potentially widening its moat .  InQ1 2025, AppLovin exceeded expectations for Q1 2025 . Total revenue was $1.484 billion, up 40% YoY and about $100 million above management's guidance for the quarter . The fast growth of the ad business more than compensated for the decline in games .  AppLovin's Rule of 40 score is extraordinary . Last quarter, it hit 96, a figure I haven't seen elsewhere, and it wasn't a one-off . The games sale will bring in $150 million cash at closing plus a $250 million promissory note (paid over time)  Management guided Advertising revenue of $1.205 billion mid-point for Q2 (70% YoY) and Advertising adjusted EBITDA of $980 million . AppLovin's share price has surged roughly 300% over the past twelve months . Despite an incredible climb, the company's fundamentals have tracked the stock price rather than hype .  Despite its high growth, profitability has been growing rapidly, and the stock isn't ridiculously expensive as one might think . With the stock at $324 per share, traditional multiples such as price-to-sales (P/S) are above its peers, however, the PEG ratio (PEG ratio) is the smallest among its peers at 0.7x .  AppLovin serves fewer than 1,000 web advertisers today, roughly 0.1% of its addressable universe . IMARC value theglobal in-app advertising market at $191.8 billion in 2024 and forecast it to reach $821.8billion by 2033 .  There was speculation in mid-2025 that AppLovin might be added to the S&P during an index rebalancing (especially after it sustained profitability and the stock price climbed) As it wasn't included in the June 2025 shuffle, it caused a brief sell-off in the stock .  High-flying stocks tend to attract short-seller attention, and those reports, regardless of substance, can shake the market . The third risk is execution in new verticals . E-commerce, connected-TV and OEM app distribution expand the addressable market .  AppLovin crossed the line from unprofitable to a high-margin platform in two years . Advertising revenue rose 71% YoY in the latest quarter, adjusted EBITDA margin sits above 67%. Management guides the core platform to an 81% margin as the low-growth games division exits .  The same discipline that led management to cut head-count in 2022, spin off the apps portfolio in 2025 and buy back stock at opportunistic prices underpins my confidence that they will protect margins . In my opinion, the stock should outperform the market if management keeps executing .",positive,"apps, applovin, app, advertiser, ads"
" Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the most well-known companies, belonging to the mag-7 . From a fundamental perspective, Microsoft is a strong company, with a gross profit margin of 69.7% and an EBITDA margin of 55.25%, far above the industry medians of 50.78% and 10.48% . The ROE is great at 33.61%, while the industry median is only at 4.96% .  Microsoft's EV/EBITDA ratio at 22.8 is a 31% premium to the industry median . P/S and P/B ratios are even more elevated at 12.51 and 10.49, suggesting a 311% and 214% premium . Only ROE growth is a weak point in this sector, with both current and forward ROE Growth expected to be negative .  Microsoft is one of the most expensive Mag-7 companies, having a market cap of 3.35T . At around 1.5 billion users, the company has a valuation of $2.233 per user . At the same time, GOOG and META only have valuations of $820 and $494 per user, respectively, making them much cheaper in comparison .  Meta is beating MSFT in almost every category, with MSFT only slightly exceeding in EBITDA margins . At the same time, META trades at a discount between 15% and 30% depending on the ratio . GOOG has a far lower P/FCF ratio at 27.1 compared to MSFT's 51.2 .  Major concerns for Microsoft is the company's big exposure to AI, due to its aggressive investments in this sector . While it could be a long-term growth factor, one should also consider the increased competition in the sector .  Microsoft is not as immune to geopolitical tensions as one might think . A collapse in foreign relations could increase the costs of hardware for the company . From a technical perspective, MSFT looks fine but not great . The company has seen increased insider selling over the past few months .  Figure 3 further shows that the company is trading above its 200-day simple moving average, indicating lower volatility and higher returns . However, it is currently at a resistance at $454 and could bounce back from here .",positive,"microsoft, nasdaq, market, valuation, msft"

" Alphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 52 brokerage firms . Of the 52 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 40 are Strong Buy and four are Buy .  The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it . For every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations . This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors .  The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations . The Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions . It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5. Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations .

In contrast, ABR is driven by earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research . Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month .

As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias . Brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation .  Using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision . ABR is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future .

" Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks might be the big thing on Wall Street, but that doesn't mean there aren't good values to be found . Some AI stocks are surprisingly cheap considering the growth potential of the technology . Some of the big tech stocks leading the charge look downright undervalued .  Alphabet has been at the forefront of artificial intelligence for at least a decade . The company acquired the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014 . Investors seem to be wary of the stock because of pressure on the regulatory front and concerns that generative AI chatbots pose a threat to the dominance of Google Search .  Alphabet could receive a fine or be forced to divest part of its business, but at the current valuation, any risk looks sufficiently priced in . Another wide-moat AI stock worth taking a look at is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing .  TSMC has been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, as both revenue and profit have soared lately . In the first quarter, TSMC's revenue jumped 35.3% year over year to $25.5 billion, and net income rose 60% to $10.9 billion . Some consider TSMC risky because it's headquartered in Taiwan, a disputed territory .  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has diversified away from Taiwan, opening plants in the U.S., Europe, and Japan . Based on its technological strength, growth rate, attractive valuation, and tailwinds from AI, TSMC looks well-positioned for long-term growth .

" Shares of electric vehicle manufacturerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)have dropped by 21% on the year . While Tesla's core EV business continues to struggle, I think shares are poised for an epic comeback . A bullish narrative surrounding robotaxi has fueled some recent excitement in Tesla stock as of late .  Tesla investors understand that Elon Musk's vision for the company is not just to sell the most EVs . Musk has been focusing on various elements of artificial intelligence (AI) and how the technology can be used to transform Tesla . Right now, the most immediate AI use case for Tesla is commercializing autonomous driving software .  Among Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, these three cloud computing giants are forecast to spend nearly $260 billion in AIcapital expenditures just this year . Investors might want to see some tangible return on investment in the form of accelerating revenue and widening profit margins .  The primary catalyst fueling Tesla stock right now seems to be the robotaxi launch . At its core, the company's self-driving technology is a software product -- meaning it carries higher profit margins than the traditional automobile business .  Tesla stock has steadily been climbing over the last month-and-a-half . But I would caution investors from buying into the idea that now is an opportunity to take advantage of a dip . Musk himself has made it explicitly clear that the robotaxi will not be a meaningful financial contributor for Tesla for at least a year .  Tesla stock will outperform its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers over the next six months . But I actually think investing in the stock is a bit risky at the moment . A more prudent approach to an investment in Tesla is to see how the Robotaxi business scalers in the coming months while learning how impactful this new segment is for the entire business .

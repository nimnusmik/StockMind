" Amazon Web Services isn't betting on one large language model (LLM) winning the AI race . Instead, it's offering customers a buffet of models to choose from . The cloud computing arm of Amazon aims to become the go-to infrastructure layer for the AI economy .  Two years after its launch, Bedrock is now the fastest-growing service offered by AWS . It's why Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sees Bedrock as a core part of the company’s AI growth strategy .  Amazon created the project Bedrock. known as Code Whisperer, launched in 2023 . The team realized they could offer the service for a broader set of use cases . Many analysts don't consider Amazon to be leading the AI race, even though it has ramped up its spending .  In November 2024, Amazon doubled its investment in Anthropic to $8 billion in a deal that requires it to train its large language model, Claude, using primarily AWS’s chips . The deal allows Amazon to prove out its AI training infrastructure and deepen ties with one LLM provider .  Revenue at AWS increased 16.9% to $29.27 billion in Q1, marking the third time in a row it missed analyst estimates despite double-digit growth . The Anthropic partnership underscores a bigger competition AWS may be fighting with chipmakers .  AWS doesn’t break out its costs for AI, CEO Andy Jassy said in February that the “vast majority of that capex spend is on AI for AWS” It’s a bet that Amazon is willing to spend on .  Anthropic is AWS's sole training partner . We also clarified the relationship between CodeWhisperer and Bedrock . We regret the errors .",neutral,"aws, amazon, cloud, billion, ai"
" The protests against the president’s immigration crackdown in the city began on Friday, as ICE raids broke out among several majority-Latino neighborhoodssuch as Paramount . Trump deemed the protests sufficiently disruptive to send in 2,000 National Guard troops Saturday .  On Sunday, protesters set at least five Waymo vehicles ablaze in downtown L.A. They were protesting against the company's self-driving car service . Around 100 of Waymo’s 1,500 robotaxis currently operate in Los Angeles .  Setting cars on fire has a long history in protest going back at least to 1992 Los Angeles riots . Though obviously illegal, igniting cars tends to serve as a defiant expression of rage . One reason protesters might be choosing Waymos is because they are owned by a massive tech company .  The LAPD is known to requisition and publish footage from Waymos to solve crimes around the city . Some protesters may have targeted Waymos because the cars may be essentially collecting evidence for future trials . However, vandalism of the cars seems extremely traceable .  A Waymo robot taxi was set on fire in San Francisco in February 2024 . The fire was sparked by a protest against autonomous cabs . CNN’s Brian Stelter described the blaze as “something out of a dystopian sci-fi novel”  Fast Company's Fast Company newsletter: http://www.fastcompany.com/newsletters .

" Apple announced a bunch of highly personalized AI features last June . Apple seemed poised to at last reap the rewards of its longtime effort to build trust around user data privacy .  WWDC 2025 keynote address was a throwback to years past, with a litany of modest UX and feature upgrades to iOS and the other Apple operating systems . In iOS, they showed us a breezy new UX look (featuring translucent app and widget panels) and refreshed icon design .  iPhone users can already tap on real-world objects via their phone camera to get more information . Now, they can do the same withinanyapp, including social media, to identify and learn about objects . Apple had every opportunity to own personal AI .  ChatGPT is learning users’ tastes, preferences, and memory . Apple’s former design guru is helping OpenAI build a hardware device that could harness all that power . I was optimistic when Apple hired John Giannandrea away from Google in April 2018 .  Giannandrea still leads Apple’s “core AI” division, but Siri and robotics have since been moved out from under his leadership . The next big thing is here, and Apple isn’t at the forefront .",positive,"ios, apple, iphone, ai, privacy"
" LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton partners with Google Cloud to ramp up its AI capabilities . Cloud-based AI solutions underpin virtually every transaction made by the world’s biggest luxury group . The group recorded revenues of 84.7 billion euros in 2024 .  LVMH continues to work with Google to develop new applications for AI and genAI .

LVMH is guarded about Google’s moves to harness AI with new functions that act like a personal shopper . “These are luxury sites, after all, and we prefer human interaction,” Le Moal said .  LVMH has trained some 1,500 data experts over the last four years, ranging from data scientists to analysts, engineers and architects . A further 15,000 employees have been through its “Data and AI Academy”  LVMH and Google have stepped up their efforts to combat cyber attacks on luxury brands . Attacks on U.K. retailers including Marks & Spencer and Harrods have led to a series of cyber attacks . Google’s Threat Intelligence Group recently warned that the U.S. retail sector is also being targeted in extortion operations .  Google has beefed up its cybersecurity capabilities through the 2022 acquisition of cyber defense and response vendor Mandiant . With shrinking demand and geopolitical turmoil roiling luxury stocks, technology will be key to gaining an edge over the competition, said Le Moal .  The U.S. accounting for 24 percent of LVMH’s revenues in the first quarter, thethreat of trade tariffs looms large over its immediate fortunes . Google has anticipated potential evolutions by establishing trusted cloud solutions, for instance through its joint venture with French defense andtechnologyfirm Thales .  At Viva Tech, LVMH plans to showcase collaborations between 11 of its luxury maisons and 13 technology partners . One of its houses will present an agent that can automatically generate marketing content while respecting the brand’s tone of voice .  Viva Tech will be the use and integration of AI and genAI technologies into everyday life . “Unlike the metaverse, which was a flash-in-the-pan, we’re talking about a profound transformation that’s here to stay.”",neutral,"ai, agents, lvmh, agent, cloud"

" Barclays Plc is preparing to cut more than 200 jobs in its investment bank . The reduction represents about 3% of the investment bank’s headcount . The cuts are meant to give the bank more capacity to invest in priority areas, one of the people said .  Move is not a sign that the bank is retrenching away from any products or asset classes, a person said . Barclays has committed to its costly transatlantic investment banking model in the face of pressure from investors .

" A 28-year-old AI executive named Alexandr Wang came to Capitol Hill to tell policymakers what they needed to do to maintain US dominance . Wang, the chief executive officer of Scale AI, may not be a household name in the same way OpenAI’s Sam Altman has become . Lawmakers welcomed his feedback .  Scale is in talks to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Scale, Bloomberg News reports . The startup was valued at about $14 billion in 2024 . It's enlisting PhDs, nurses and other experts with advanced degrees to develop more sophisticated models .  Scale’s trajectory has shaped, and been shaped by, the AI boom that OpenAI unleashed . In its early years, Scale focused more on labeling images of cars, traffic lights and street signs to help train the models used to build self-driving cars . It has since helped to annotate and curate the massive amounts of text data needed to build the large language models that power chatbots like ChatGPT .  Scale has faced scrutiny for relying on thousands of contractors overseas who were paid relatively little to weed through reams of online data . The U.S. Department of Labor recently dropped an investigation into the company’s compliance with fair labor regulations .  Leading AI labs are struggling to get enough high-quality training data to build more advanced AI systems that are capable of fielding complex tasks as well as, or better than, humans . Scale has increasingly turned to better-paid contractors with graduate degrees to improve AI systems .  Scale generated about $870 million in revenue in 2024 and expects $2 billion in revenue this year, Bloomberg News reported in April . The company has deepened its relationship with the US government through defense deals .  Meta is partnering with Scale to help it keep pace with AI rivals like Google and OpenAI . A tie-up with Scale offers a powerful and deep-pocketed ally . It would also be a fitting full-circle moment for Wang, who said he was inspired by Facebook .

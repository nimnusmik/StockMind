Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has a 67% market share in the third-party chip foundry space . Alphabet's advertising business is sensitive to economic conditions but has shown great long-term growth .  TSMC is the world's largest semiconductor foundry, with a market share in contract chipmaking space of around 67% . It's the go-to chip fabricator for well-known companies like Apple, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and dozens of others .

TSMC is in a complex spot geopolitically due both to the tense relationship between Taiwan and China and the ongoing U.S. push to boost domestic manufacturing .  Of the $90.2 billion in revenue Alphabet made in Q1, 74% came from advertising . The cyclical nature of Alphabet's business may not be comfortable for investors who prefer more predictable income, but it doesn't take away from the company's long-term value .

Inference is less technically demanding, with more emphasis on latency, power, and cost . AMD recently said one of the largest AI model companies is using its chips for a significant portion of its daily inference traffic .  If inference spending takes off and AMD can grab some share, its stock should have a lot of upsides from here . Another beneficiary of the AI infrastructure boom isTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing .  TSMC looks like a great way to play the continued growth of AI and advanced semiconductors . The biggest risk is a slowdown in AI infrastructure spending, which could hit both revenue and fab utilization .

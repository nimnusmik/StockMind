" In this podcast, Motley Fool analyst Asit Sharma joins host Mary Long to discuss the complex problems that quantum computers could solve . In the show, Sharma discusses the healthcare and logistics companies benefit from ultra-fast processing .  The Motley Fool senior analyst Asit Sharma and Mary Long discuss quantum computing . They discuss the potential of quantum computing, what investors need to know about this technology . Quantum's future may come sooner than you think, they say .  Asit Sharma, a resident quantum industry expert, joins us to talk about quantum computing . Sharma: The promise of quantum computing is to solve intensely complex, large scale problems with a lot of variables .  While it sounds like it's all powerful, quantum computing isn't going to be applied to simple problems to solve them faster . Think really difficult things like predicting the weather . Classical computers have a lot of trouble with solving things linearly one step at a time .  Everything running through a computer, including AI computation is based on this very discrete binary system of zeros and ones added together . Quantum computing is a little different in that it takes a concept from quantum mechanics, which is one of the mysteries that underlines our physical existence .  If a particle can exist as one discrete thing, but also a wave function at the same time, it means that we can trap that particle and have it sit in a state of what's called superposition . A state of superposition means that that particle will encompass all the possibilities or probabilities of being a zero or a one . Quantum computing is a way to look at something that could be any number of possibilities, and the idea of a quantum computer is to direct the way that wave function collapses .  Asit Sharma: Generative AI is very suited to looking for patterns in sequential pieces of data . But you can only do so much with that. sort of show us the results we want that will be more probabilistically aligned with what we want to see .  Classical computing can only do so much when you're trying to figure out this one problem . But a quantum computer could really scale up and look at all the possibilities . We can get a better understanding of this binding from molecule to protein .  Asit Sharma: There are different industries that can benefit from quantum computing technology . One, surprisingly, is surprisingly, the delivery of goods, he says . Sharma: When you think about practical goods that could come from such technology, what are those goods?  Quantum computing may be very good at in the future is quickly solving some of this stuff . The idea of trying to understand risk across many, many companies or even within a single company .  Asit Sharma: We have some fledgling quantum computers that have been built and are functional . They are mostly being used by research institutions, but we're starting to see Fortune 500 companies utilize these computers in very basic types of experimental computations .  A lot of energy is going into solving for the errors in quantum computations . We have to keep those in a state that remains in superposition, meaning that it's got that state of lots of probabilities if we're trapping one ion and asking it to do it to solve the problems .  We don't want it to interact with the environment. perform computations. That can make that function collapse more quickly, and we won't get the desired results . Right now things are still at an experimental state, but we have reached a stage where companies are solving some smaller real world problems .  Asit Sharma: There's a lot to unpack with what Jensen Wong said, Mary. We're using less energy to actually make these computers operate. Decoherence? Is the usefulness of these quantum computers that Jensen's predicting? Is it that they're more useful because they can solve more difficult problems?  Jensen Huang said he didn't realize there were publicly traded companies that were building quantum computers . He invited some of the CEOs of the companies that have built quantum computers onto the stage to explain to the audience why he was wrong to say that . But he's right in that the timescale is not going to be 2026 .  quantum computer is going to be able to perform a task better than the best alternative we have that exists in a classical computer for a useful problem . When that occurs, many people will say we've reached a point where we have an inflection or a tipping point, maybe like a ChatGPT moment .  The primary computational unit in quantum computing is called a qubit . This is where you are using one particle and you are performing operations on that particle to get that probabilistic result . We have to be able to have qubits scale up. Many qubits, which are already prone to errors, are able to solve problems and then communicate with each other .  Entanglement is cool, but we can use entanglement to do computation . We can influence through certain quantum algorithms . When we take one qubit and then add another and add another, we can scale that system up . We're going to see a lot of, I'm going to call them quantum bros in advance, talking about where you should be investing .  IBM, Microsoft, and Google are building their own quantum computers from the ground up . Asit Sharma: These companies are building out all the supporting technology that powers these systems .  Alphabet has a chip called Willow that reduces error rates . IBM has a processor called the Heron quantum processor . Microsoft got fascinated with a type of approach, which is very theoretical .  Microsoft had to prove existence of what had been a theoretical particle called the Moderna Fermion . But in doing so, their approach is more fault-tolerant than the other approaches . The coded information is very stable and so it's taking an approach which is based on design .  Asit Sharma: I admire Microsoft for its ambition and the investments of however 100 millions they made . Mary Long: Apart from those three big dogs that you just walked us through, is anybody else currently working on building out a full-stack quantum computer?  Quantinuum is actually a joint venture between a company, it's very small company out of the UK, which merged up in this joint venture with the giantHoneywell computing . The company also has really a host platform, as IBM does .  Amazon is taking a totally different approach than the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet, and IBM . Rather than building out this full-stack computer, they're providing quantum computing access through its Cloud platform . It's like AWS, but for quantum computing, Asit Sharma says .  Amazon is using its might and its Cloud platform to further the quantum computing industry along, says Mary Kay . Kay: If one of these smaller companies really takes off? Well, they're already on Amazon's platform, and that will help Amazon scale up its quantum business . That's the advantage, Kay says, but the disadvantage is that Amazon doesn't have to make its own quantum computers .  Amazon is hosting the actual cryogenic systems for some of these other companies . It's getting a first-hand view of what it takes to build these computers to operate them . Amazon is also developing some interesting add-ons to its ecosystem .  Amazon's Brackett system is one of seven companies that are working on quantum computing . IonQand Righetti Computing are both companies that develop quantum systems that can link up to the Cloud .  D-Wave quantum has its approach this annealing, it fits right into Baquet. Ion Q, as I mentioned before, trapping ions, it goes right up into Amazon Baquete. Rigetti computing, also has a more modular approach.  Asit Sharma: The chipmakers right now are mostly looking at how their applications will be able to accelerate the development of quantum computing . Mary Long: What about chipmakers and chip designers? How do they fit into this future quantum landscape?  Synopsis is acquiring a company called ANSIS, which specializes in physics simulations . The chip designers, the electronic design automation companies, I think, have a role to play in quantum computing . The next step is looking at how you can transmit information from one quantum system to another .  There's a lot of interesting work that's happening among the smaller players in the quantum industry and in the biotech space, but it's highly technical . A lot of those small upstarts aren't profitable, so it's hard to make a good judgment about their financial situation . In the healthcare industry, rather than investing in biotech, if that feels a little bit too crazy to touch, what you can do is go to the big dogs .  Asit Sharma: The downside is that some of these smaller players may scale more quickly than would think at a first glance . The benefit in my mind, of applying this biotech approach to the quantum industry and investing in it, that feels obvious .  Quantum computing is going to open up a Pandora's box in encryption standards, says Dr. Andrew Keen . Keen: Quantum computing will open up Pandora's Box in all of our encryption standards .  A company that's very small like Ion Q which is thinking of building these large quantum networks over distances in addition to its own computer, has potentially a solution for a secure network that a bank could use . There is some possibility that a few of these companies, just like the little biotechs that you alluded to, could blow up . Could there be binary outcomes where you put your money in and it's either boom or bust? Sure .  Jensen Wong had an idea that 15-30 years in the future, this thing could be big . It's fun if you could identify a company and you're able to hold it for 20 years . It might not hurt to buy some shares in a few forward-looking companies that are embracing quantum .  Asit Sharma: Quantum computing is at least five years away, but he thinks it'll come sooner than that 15-30 year initial time frame . Sharma: Companies that are embracing it will be customers of the big dogs, maybe one or two big dogs .

" Motley Fool analyst Tim Beyers and host Ricky Mulvey discuss Walmart's response to tariff uncertainty . How YouTube is capitalizing on points of ""maximum attention"" Karl Thiel joins host Mary Long to dive into the executive order on prescription drug prices and questions for pharmaceutical companies .  Stock Advisor’s total average return is 957% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to167% for the S&P 500 . If you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $804,688! The Motley Fool Money podcast was recorded on May 15, 2025 .  Tim Beyers: The big story here, Tim, is tariffs . Chief Financial Officer, John David Rainey, went on CNBC and said, ""We're wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb"" He says, if Walmart is under pressure to raise prices, it's going to have broader effects on the economy .  Walmart's e-commerce business rose 22% on the year and it was the first quarter of profitability . Ricky Mulvey: Even for a giant, it's really hard to make a profit, even for Walmart, which is pretty darn efficient .  The last few quarters have seen tailwinds for this company, including in the e-commerce channel . But we think of them as everyday low prices and everything . It's less clear whether this company can keep its brand advantage .  CFO Rainey: Walmart is not the kind of company that sells something so unique that it can make margin on uniqueness of what flows through distribution channel . Mulvey: Millions of people would feel an immense amount of pain if Walmart were to suddenly go away. But right now, it's also trading at a historically high valuation .  Walmart trades for 1.2 times revenue and a 1.4% free cash flow yield . Tim Beyers: If you're holding a defensive, maybe a cyclical stock like this, should you be sweating this a little bit?  Walmart is not the kind of business that I would be inclined to sell, but I might be just more careful with it, Ricky Mulvey says . Mulvey: Buyers might be prepared to hold for a decade or longer, collect your dividends as cash and then reinvest .  The ad supported tier has 94 million monthly active users . That's grown by more than 20 million people since November . The ad tier of Netflix reaches more 18-34 year-olds than any US broadcast or cable network .  Beyers: ""I think its success reflects something important that Netflix has quite a lot of family friendly, kid-friendly, popcorn worthy programming that pulls in younger adults"" Mulvey: ""There's just room to penetrate really across the age spectrum""  Netflix is unveiling how they're thinking about ads into the future . The basic promise is that we have this fabulous algorithm that can recommend shows to people based on their viewing habits . The part that sounds a little scarier to me is this offer of shoppable mid roles in AI-driven dynamic product placement inside hit shows like Squid Game .  More important than the AI tools, I think, is the vastness and variety of the content library . I doubt that the AI is going to immediately have margin impact . I think scale is what matters for Netflix here . If this continues, scale means there will be big winners and big losers .  Tim Beyers: The expansion of the advertising tier, especially worldwide, is the most important thing . Ricky Mulvey: For advertisers, consider Squid Game as a show that is about how money makes people do awful and terrible things, it all scales up the wealth ladder .  Ricky Mulvey: Operating margin expansion has been on the menu for Netflix for a while now . I would be watching for it coinciding with revenue growth in overseas territories . If we get expanding operating margin plus big growth in non-US non-Canadian territories, I think we're really onto something here, because those two together signal pricing power in emerging markets, which is really hard to get .  The Motley Fool Live blog is a great place to get analyst insights in what's going on in the market . YouTube believes there is value to advertisers in placing ads at points of maximum attention . Tim Beyers: It might be a little bit annoying, but I'm just going to say here, this is payback time .  Ricky Mulvey: Will it be the kind of thing that will drive up ad prices? That's a maybe . There is a logic to it, but more importantly, this is the thing that allows YouTube to price ad space at a premium, which they do need to do .  Tim Beyers: How meaningful is this for Alphabet as a whole, as a two-trillion-dollar company? He says it could be the thing that disconnects YouTube from a reliance on search . If YouTube figures this out and gets better at selling premium advertising disconnected from the parent ad business, it adds a creative value .  The Fundrises Flagship Fund, a 1.1 billion dollar real estate portfolio, has more than 4,000 single family homes in the Sunbelt communities . The flagship fund taps into some of real estate's most attractive qualities, long term appreciation potential, and a hedge against inflation .  A prescription for a weight loss drug will cost you about $1,000 per month more in the US than it will in Europe . President Trump rolled out an executive order that attempts to bring that price down to the lowest level across developed countries . Up next, up next, Motley Fool senior analyst Karl Thiel joins our colleague Mary Long to break down the prescription drug pricing executive order .  Trump said in a press conference that the US is subsidizing other countries' drug prices . Even though the US represents the largest pharma market in the world, there are essentially three pharma markets . There's the US, there's Europe, and there's Asia .  The US is essentially the profit center for global drug sales . Europe is twice the size and only 23% of sales, Asia is only 21% . Drugs here cost somewhere on the order of two to four times what they do in Europe . In China, prices can run something like 10 times .  Karl Thiel: How do these lesser known characters, the PBMs, actually fit into this picture of drug pricing? Thiel: This is unique to the United States that you have this extra layer called pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs . Thiel: A lot of drug executives have been pointing the fingers at PBMs as the middlemen who are really responsible for high prices .  If drug companies had to make the best of a bad situation, they would likely just preserve their high list prices and just offer bigger rebates . Pharmacy benefit managers would have profited off of that . Part of the idea is that you need to take a bite .  Karl Thiel: How can an executive order from an American president mandate the pricing power of individual companies, especially those that are headquartered and based overseas, not on American soil . Thiel: A lot of what people are talking about when they talk about this proposal right now is not what just got announced because that's fairly short on details . But what's different this time around is that it's actually much broader .  In order to actually make a system that work, you'd have to pass new laws . That means you need cooperation of Congress and the cooperation of the courts . To do that, there is no enforcement mechanism, which is why it's basically right now just a request that companies lower prices .  Pharmaceutical companies will lose some of the profits that they've come to expect, says Karl Thiel . Thiel: ""If it moves forward the way as envisioned, then certainly companies would see their profits go down"" Thiel: There's no real mechanism to make prices go up in Europe .  Trump's promise to get rid of the middlemen in drug pricing is not likely to be affected by changes in this industry moving forward . Mary Long: There are other healthcare companies that I can see potentially being affected by these changes .  A big part of the reason that there's this focus on PBMs is because of the way the industry has evolved . What happens is that companies set a list price, and then they negotiate rebates with PBMs . The bigger the rebate, the bigger the profit for the PBM is. They take a part of that rebate for themselves .  Karl Thiel: ""Everybody took the 5% discounted one because that one came with huge rebates. That's the somewhat counterintuitive, I will say, incentives in this industry"" Ricky Mulvey: ""That's not the whole picture, but that is part of it."" Mary Long: Karl Thiel, thank you so much for the insight and for helping to demystify this industry .

" Alphabet is facing three primary challenges to its current business . It has still put up strong growth despite these headwinds . Alphabet generates 56% of its revenue from Google Search, making it a vital part of its business .  Google has already implemented AI search overviews, which bridge the gap between older search technology and new generative AI models . Google has also developed an AI mode for its search engine, so it's already positioned itself for the new age of AI . Another fear is that an economic downturn will hurt Alphabet .  Alphabet has been found guilty of operating two illegal monopolies (one in search, one in advertising) It's still battling through courts about what the remedy will be (or if it'll still be found guilty if an appeal lands it in front of a higher court) I think all three challenges can be navigated .

" In this podcast, Motley Fool analyst Asit Sharma joins host Mary Long to discuss the complex problems that quantum computers could solve . In the show, Sharma discusses the healthcare and logistics companies benefit from ultra-fast processing .  The Motley Fool senior analyst Asit Sharma and Mary Long discuss quantum computing . They discuss the potential of quantum computing, what investors need to know about this technology . Quantum's future may come sooner than you think, they say .  Asit Sharma, a resident quantum industry expert, joins us to talk about quantum computing . Sharma: The promise of quantum computing is to solve intensely complex, large scale problems with a lot of variables .  While it sounds like it's all powerful, quantum computing isn't going to be applied to simple problems to solve them faster . Think really difficult things like predicting the weather . Classical computers have a lot of trouble with solving things linearly one step at a time .  Everything running through a computer, including AI computation is based on this very discrete binary system of zeros and ones added together . Quantum computing is a little different in that it takes a concept from quantum mechanics, which is one of the mysteries that underlines our physical existence .  If a particle can exist as one discrete thing, but also a wave function at the same time, it means that we can trap that particle and have it sit in a state of what's called superposition . A state of superposition means that that particle will encompass all the possibilities or probabilities of being a zero or a one . Quantum computing is a way to look at something that could be any number of possibilities, and the idea of a quantum computer is to direct the way that wave function collapses .  Asit Sharma: Generative AI is very suited to looking for patterns in sequential pieces of data . But you can only do so much with that. sort of show us the results we want that will be more probabilistically aligned with what we want to see .  Classical computing can only do so much when you're trying to figure out this one problem . But a quantum computer could really scale up and look at all the possibilities . We can get a better understanding of this binding from molecule to protein .  Asit Sharma: There are different industries that can benefit from quantum computing technology . One, surprisingly, is surprisingly, the delivery of goods, he says . Sharma: When you think about practical goods that could come from such technology, what are those goods?  Quantum computing may be very good at in the future is quickly solving some of this stuff . The idea of trying to understand risk across many, many companies or even within a single company .  Asit Sharma: We have some fledgling quantum computers that have been built and are functional . They are mostly being used by research institutions, but we're starting to see Fortune 500 companies utilize these computers in very basic types of experimental computations .  A lot of energy is going into solving for the errors in quantum computations . We have to keep those in a state that remains in superposition, meaning that it's got that state of lots of probabilities if we're trapping one ion and asking it to do it to solve the problems .  We don't want it to interact with the environment. perform computations. That can make that function collapse more quickly, and we won't get the desired results . Right now things are still at an experimental state, but we have reached a stage where companies are solving some smaller real world problems .  Asit Sharma: There's a lot to unpack with what Jensen Wong said, Mary. We're using less energy to actually make these computers operate. Decoherence? Is the usefulness of these quantum computers that Jensen's predicting? Is it that they're more useful because they can solve more difficult problems?  Jensen Huang said he didn't realize there were publicly traded companies that were building quantum computers . He invited some of the CEOs of the companies that have built quantum computers onto the stage to explain to the audience why he was wrong to say that . But he's right in that the timescale is not going to be 2026 .  quantum computer is going to be able to perform a task better than the best alternative we have that exists in a classical computer for a useful problem . When that occurs, many people will say we've reached a point where we have an inflection or a tipping point, maybe like a ChatGPT moment .  The primary computational unit in quantum computing is called a qubit . This is where you are using one particle and you are performing operations on that particle to get that probabilistic result . We have to be able to have qubits scale up. Many qubits, which are already prone to errors, are able to solve problems and then communicate with each other .  Entanglement is cool, but we can use entanglement to do computation . We can influence through certain quantum algorithms . When we take one qubit and then add another and add another, we can scale that system up . We're going to see a lot of, I'm going to call them quantum bros in advance, talking about where you should be investing .  IBM, Microsoft, and Google are building their own quantum computers from the ground up . Asit Sharma: These companies are building out all the supporting technology that powers these systems .  Alphabet has a chip called Willow that reduces error rates . IBM has a processor called the Heron quantum processor . Microsoft got fascinated with a type of approach, which is very theoretical .  Microsoft had to prove existence of what had been a theoretical particle called the Moderna Fermion . But in doing so, their approach is more fault-tolerant than the other approaches . The coded information is very stable and so it's taking an approach which is based on design .  Asit Sharma: I admire Microsoft for its ambition and the investments of however 100 millions they made . Mary Long: Apart from those three big dogs that you just walked us through, is anybody else currently working on building out a full-stack quantum computer?  Quantinuum is actually a joint venture between a company, it's very small company out of the UK, which merged up in this joint venture with the giantHoneywell computing . The company also has really a host platform, as IBM does .  Amazon is taking a totally different approach than the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet, and IBM . Rather than building out this full-stack computer, they're providing quantum computing access through its Cloud platform . It's like AWS, but for quantum computing, Asit Sharma says .  Amazon is using its might and its Cloud platform to further the quantum computing industry along, says Mary Kay . Kay: If one of these smaller companies really takes off? Well, they're already on Amazon's platform, and that will help Amazon scale up its quantum business . That's the advantage, Kay says, but the disadvantage is that Amazon doesn't have to make its own quantum computers .  Amazon is hosting the actual cryogenic systems for some of these other companies . It's getting a first-hand view of what it takes to build these computers to operate them . Amazon is also developing some interesting add-ons to its ecosystem .  Amazon's Brackett system is one of seven companies that are working on quantum computing . IonQand Righetti Computing are both companies that develop quantum systems that can link up to the Cloud .  D-Wave quantum has its approach this annealing, it fits right into Baquet. Ion Q, as I mentioned before, trapping ions, it goes right up into Amazon Baquete. Rigetti computing, also has a more modular approach.  Asit Sharma: The chipmakers right now are mostly looking at how their applications will be able to accelerate the development of quantum computing . Mary Long: What about chipmakers and chip designers? How do they fit into this future quantum landscape?  Synopsis is acquiring a company called ANSIS, which specializes in physics simulations . The chip designers, the electronic design automation companies, I think, have a role to play in quantum computing . The next step is looking at how you can transmit information from one quantum system to another .  There's a lot of interesting work that's happening among the smaller players in the quantum industry and in the biotech space, but it's highly technical . A lot of those small upstarts aren't profitable, so it's hard to make a good judgment about their financial situation . In the healthcare industry, rather than investing in biotech, if that feels a little bit too crazy to touch, what you can do is go to the big dogs .  Asit Sharma: The downside is that some of these smaller players may scale more quickly than would think at a first glance . The benefit in my mind, of applying this biotech approach to the quantum industry and investing in it, that feels obvious .  Quantum computing is going to open up a Pandora's box in encryption standards, says Dr. Andrew Keen . Keen: Quantum computing will open up Pandora's Box in all of our encryption standards .  A company that's very small like Ion Q which is thinking of building these large quantum networks over distances in addition to its own computer, has potentially a solution for a secure network that a bank could use . There is some possibility that a few of these companies, just like the little biotechs that you alluded to, could blow up . Could there be binary outcomes where you put your money in and it's either boom or bust? Sure .  Jensen Wong had an idea that 15-30 years in the future, this thing could be big . It's fun if you could identify a company and you're able to hold it for 20 years . It might not hurt to buy some shares in a few forward-looking companies that are embracing quantum .  Asit Sharma: Quantum computing is at least five years away, but he thinks it'll come sooner than that 15-30 year initial time frame . Sharma: Companies that are embracing it will be customers of the big dogs, maybe one or two big dogs .

" Motley Fool analyst Tim Beyers and host Ricky Mulvey discuss Walmart's response to tariff uncertainty . How YouTube is capitalizing on points of ""maximum attention"" Karl Thiel joins host Mary Long to dive into the executive order on prescription drug prices and questions for pharmaceutical companies .  Stock Advisor’s total average return is 957% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to167% for the S&P 500 . If you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $804,688! The Motley Fool Money podcast was recorded on May 15, 2025 .  Tim Beyers: The big story here, Tim, is tariffs . Chief Financial Officer, John David Rainey, went on CNBC and said, ""We're wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb"" He says, if Walmart is under pressure to raise prices, it's going to have broader effects on the economy .  Walmart's e-commerce business rose 22% on the year and it was the first quarter of profitability . Ricky Mulvey: Even for a giant, it's really hard to make a profit, even for Walmart, which is pretty darn efficient .  The last few quarters have seen tailwinds for this company, including in the e-commerce channel . But we think of them as everyday low prices and everything . It's less clear whether this company can keep its brand advantage .  CFO Rainey: Walmart is not the kind of company that sells something so unique that it can make margin on uniqueness of what flows through distribution channel . Mulvey: Millions of people would feel an immense amount of pain if Walmart were to suddenly go away. But right now, it's also trading at a historically high valuation .  Walmart trades for 1.2 times revenue and a 1.4% free cash flow yield . Tim Beyers: If you're holding a defensive, maybe a cyclical stock like this, should you be sweating this a little bit?  Walmart is not the kind of business that I would be inclined to sell, but I might be just more careful with it, Ricky Mulvey says . Mulvey: Buyers might be prepared to hold for a decade or longer, collect your dividends as cash and then reinvest .  The ad supported tier has 94 million monthly active users . That's grown by more than 20 million people since November . The ad tier of Netflix reaches more 18-34 year-olds than any US broadcast or cable network .  Beyers: ""I think its success reflects something important that Netflix has quite a lot of family friendly, kid-friendly, popcorn worthy programming that pulls in younger adults"" Mulvey: ""There's just room to penetrate really across the age spectrum""  Netflix is unveiling how they're thinking about ads into the future . The basic promise is that we have this fabulous algorithm that can recommend shows to people based on their viewing habits . The part that sounds a little scarier to me is this offer of shoppable mid roles in AI-driven dynamic product placement inside hit shows like Squid Game .  More important than the AI tools, I think, is the vastness and variety of the content library . I doubt that the AI is going to immediately have margin impact . I think scale is what matters for Netflix here . If this continues, scale means there will be big winners and big losers .  Tim Beyers: The expansion of the advertising tier, especially worldwide, is the most important thing . Ricky Mulvey: For advertisers, consider Squid Game as a show that is about how money makes people do awful and terrible things, it all scales up the wealth ladder .  Ricky Mulvey: Operating margin expansion has been on the menu for Netflix for a while now . I would be watching for it coinciding with revenue growth in overseas territories . If we get expanding operating margin plus big growth in non-US non-Canadian territories, I think we're really onto something here, because those two together signal pricing power in emerging markets, which is really hard to get .  The Motley Fool Live blog is a great place to get analyst insights in what's going on in the market . YouTube believes there is value to advertisers in placing ads at points of maximum attention . Tim Beyers: It might be a little bit annoying, but I'm just going to say here, this is payback time .  Ricky Mulvey: Will it be the kind of thing that will drive up ad prices? That's a maybe . There is a logic to it, but more importantly, this is the thing that allows YouTube to price ad space at a premium, which they do need to do .  Tim Beyers: How meaningful is this for Alphabet as a whole, as a two-trillion-dollar company? He says it could be the thing that disconnects YouTube from a reliance on search . If YouTube figures this out and gets better at selling premium advertising disconnected from the parent ad business, it adds a creative value .  The Fundrises Flagship Fund, a 1.1 billion dollar real estate portfolio, has more than 4,000 single family homes in the Sunbelt communities . The flagship fund taps into some of real estate's most attractive qualities, long term appreciation potential, and a hedge against inflation .  A prescription for a weight loss drug will cost you about $1,000 per month more in the US than it will in Europe . President Trump rolled out an executive order that attempts to bring that price down to the lowest level across developed countries . Up next, up next, Motley Fool senior analyst Karl Thiel joins our colleague Mary Long to break down the prescription drug pricing executive order .  Trump said in a press conference that the US is subsidizing other countries' drug prices . Even though the US represents the largest pharma market in the world, there are essentially three pharma markets . There's the US, there's Europe, and there's Asia .  The US is essentially the profit center for global drug sales . Europe is twice the size and only 23% of sales, Asia is only 21% . Drugs here cost somewhere on the order of two to four times what they do in Europe . In China, prices can run something like 10 times .  Karl Thiel: How do these lesser known characters, the PBMs, actually fit into this picture of drug pricing? Thiel: This is unique to the United States that you have this extra layer called pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs . Thiel: A lot of drug executives have been pointing the fingers at PBMs as the middlemen who are really responsible for high prices .  If drug companies had to make the best of a bad situation, they would likely just preserve their high list prices and just offer bigger rebates . Pharmacy benefit managers would have profited off of that . Part of the idea is that you need to take a bite .  Karl Thiel: How can an executive order from an American president mandate the pricing power of individual companies, especially those that are headquartered and based overseas, not on American soil . Thiel: A lot of what people are talking about when they talk about this proposal right now is not what just got announced because that's fairly short on details . But what's different this time around is that it's actually much broader .  In order to actually make a system that work, you'd have to pass new laws . That means you need cooperation of Congress and the cooperation of the courts . To do that, there is no enforcement mechanism, which is why it's basically right now just a request that companies lower prices .  Pharmaceutical companies will lose some of the profits that they've come to expect, says Karl Thiel . Thiel: ""If it moves forward the way as envisioned, then certainly companies would see their profits go down"" Thiel: There's no real mechanism to make prices go up in Europe .  Trump's promise to get rid of the middlemen in drug pricing is not likely to be affected by changes in this industry moving forward . Mary Long: There are other healthcare companies that I can see potentially being affected by these changes .  A big part of the reason that there's this focus on PBMs is because of the way the industry has evolved . What happens is that companies set a list price, and then they negotiate rebates with PBMs . The bigger the rebate, the bigger the profit for the PBM is. They take a part of that rebate for themselves .  Karl Thiel: ""Everybody took the 5% discounted one because that one came with huge rebates. That's the somewhat counterintuitive, I will say, incentives in this industry"" Ricky Mulvey: ""That's not the whole picture, but that is part of it."" Mary Long: Karl Thiel, thank you so much for the insight and for helping to demystify this industry .

" Alphabet is facing three primary challenges to its current business . It has still put up strong growth despite these headwinds . Alphabet generates 56% of its revenue from Google Search, making it a vital part of its business .  Google has already implemented AI search overviews, which bridge the gap between older search technology and new generative AI models . Google has also developed an AI mode for its search engine, so it's already positioned itself for the new age of AI . Another fear is that an economic downturn will hurt Alphabet .  Alphabet has been found guilty of operating two illegal monopolies (one in search, one in advertising) It's still battling through courts about what the remedy will be (or if it'll still be found guilty if an appeal lands it in front of a higher court) I think all three challenges can be navigated .  Alphabet isn't dead yet; it still has plenty of growth left for investors to capitalize on . At19 times trailing earnings, it's also much cheaper than the broader market, as measured by the S&P 500 . I think the stock is too cheap to ignore here, and investors should take this opportunity to load up on shares .  Stock Advisor’s total average return is 957% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to167% for the S&P 500 .

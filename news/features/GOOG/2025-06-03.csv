" President Trump wants iPhones assembled in the United States, which would be expensive for Apple . The company is grappling with potentially rising costs and lawsuits coming for its cash cows . Shares of Apple look expensive today when considering all these long-term risks .  Analysts estimate it would cost Apple tens of billions of dollars to switch manufacturing to the United States . Last quarter, Apple's product division generated just under $25 billion in gross profit, which is revenue minus manufacturing/assembly costs .  In fiscal year 2024, $71 billion of Apple's total gross profit of $181 billion came from services . This includes revenue from the App Store and distribution agreements from Google to be the default search engine on the Safari web browser .  Apple has only grown its revenue by a cumulative 3% over the last three years . The company is simply not growing much anymore as it fails to deliver any new hardware device that comes close to the popularity of the iPhone . In artificial intelligence (AI), Apple may be falling well behind the competition .  Apple trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31, which is higher than theS&P 500average and higher than Alphabet even though Alphabet is growing much faster . Apple may see its earnings finally move in the wrong direction if tariffs, lawsuits, and failures to win in AI lead to deteriorating power in the global technology landscape .

" The $500 Pixel 9a is now the cheapest entry point into Google’s Gemini AI ecosystem . While Gemini is a better assistant than it used to be on Pixel phones, it can also be a big a waste of time .  Gemini on the Pixel 9a isno longer a trainwreck than the old Google Assistant . Google has patched in a lot of that missing functionality over the past nine months . In some ways, Gemini even more useful now. I can ask for directions with a specific stop along the way, for instance .  Even Gemini Live’s ballyhooed Camera Mode feels a bit like a parlor trick . I tried using it to research a story on satellite messaging, only to discover in my own research that Gemini got a half-dozen facts wrong .  While pointing your camera at the real world, Gemini can identify and answer questions about what it sees . It recognized a mango tree on the aforementioned Florida trip, for instance, and told me that none of the fruit looked ripe enough to eat . Gemini is also the default assistant on Samsung’s latest flagships .  For $500, the Pixel 9a is a pretty good phone that I've been using in place of my usual flagships . For Gemini to really make a difference on phones, it will need to interact with more apps and services, handle data from Google’s own services more reliably .  The bezels around the display are thicker . The edges are aluminum and not stainless steel, and the rear panel is plastic instead of glass . Battery life, while better than the Pixel 9, doesn’t match Apple’s “Pro” level phones .",neutral,"gemini, pixel, samsung, apps, phones"

" Tesla will introduce its self-driving robotaxi service in June . 2025 could be the year the autonomous driving revolution takes off in earnest . Tesla has touted its competitive advantages, but will they actually come to pass?  Tesla is set to officially launch its autonomous robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June . Elon Musk says by the end of 2026, there would be hundreds of thousands, if not a million, Teslas doing self-driving in the United States .  Last quarter's deliveries were down a whopping 13%, and trailing-12-month earnings per share have more than halved . Tesla bulls such as Cathie Wood believe Tesla can become a multibagger mainly on the back of the autonomous robotaxi opportunity . Ark Invest believes 90% of that future value will come from autonomous robotaxis .  Tesla's costs per operating mile for its self-driving fleet are 20% to 25% of Waymo's . Elon Musk believes Tesla can achieve up to 90% of the autonomous driving market . Some estimates for the autonomous robotaxi market vary widely .  The danger for Tesla investors is if next month's initial rollout doesn't go as well as expected or its robotaxi service isn't as superior to Waymo's as many think it will be . As of last month, Waymo was making 250,000 rides per week, with each ride adding to its driver's intelligence and reputation for safety .  Waymo's higher costs aren't fixed at today's levels -- they're also set to decrease . The bigger cost is that of producing vehicles, which Waymo currently buys from Jaguar in low volumes . Waymo just announced that it's opening a new autonomous vehicle factory in Phoenix, Arizona .  Tesla is under a lot of pressure to deliver when it unveils its robotaxi service next month . Waymo's current momentum, five-year head start, and improvements to its mass manufacturing on the way . Tesla's initial service will comprise only 10 to 20 vehicles .  Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, available when you joinStock Advisor, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon . Apple:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008,you’d have $37,070!* Netflix: If you invested . $1k on Netflix in 2004, you'd have $639,271!",negative,"tesla, teslas, robotaxi, robotaxis, 2026"

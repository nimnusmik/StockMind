The lawsuit is an existential threat to Apple and could upend its highly lucrative mobile hardware business . The iPhone maker is accused of violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices .  The ruling tees up years of litigation . Apple says it will ""vigorously fight"" the lawsuit . The judge says allegations about Apple's intent to monopolize the smartphone market are strong enough .  Apple could still seek to settle the case — filed in March 2024 — with the Trump administration . The Justice Department’s new antitrust head, Gail Slater, said at her confirmation hearing that she plans to largely continue the strict enforcement of her predecessors .  The Justice Department and the states argue that Apple’s conduct was a deliberate attempt to box out rivals and build an illegal “moat” around the iPhone .

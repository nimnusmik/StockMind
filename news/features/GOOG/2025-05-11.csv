" Apple exec said they saw search queries decline for the first time in April . Bears jumped on this news to claim that search was a dying business . There are a number of reasons to believe the Alphabet and Google search will be just fine moving forward .  $20 billion is the amount of revenue-sharing money that Apple receives from Alphabet each year for Google to be the exclusive search engine for its Safari browser . The revenue is pure margin and accounts for more than 15% of Apple's operating income .  Apple has 20 billion reasons why it would want to depict search as becoming increasingly irrelevant . Alphabet refuted Apple's claims about its search queries declining in a blog post . It said it continued to see overall search query growth, including on Apple devices and platforms .  AI chatbots are likely to eventually have a much different monetization model than search . The cost of answering AI queries is exponentially higher than providing search results . Google isn't making money from historical or curiosity-driven questions with no commercial relevance .  Paid tiers with some advertising support are likely the future model of the AI chatbot industry . However, this is likely to make AI chatbots more complementary than replace search . Google has a huge two-sided ad network that can connect advertisers to global, national, regional, or local audiences .  Search ad prices are likely to rise as advertisers will still need effective ways to reach consumers . With fewer high-traffic platforms available, advertisers will be willing to pay a premium to access that limited supply . The company is looking to use Gemini to enhance Google search with AI .

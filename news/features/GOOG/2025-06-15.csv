" Nvidia is the king of AI accelerator chips, but some smaller AI players may have more upside . AMD has a big opportunity as the AI inference market grows . Broadcom has big opportunities in networking, custom AI chips, and virtualization .  Nvidia remains one of the best-positioned companies to continue to benefit from the ongoing AI boom . The company is now massive, and as the base used to measure its growth gets bigger, the percentage gains are likely to get smaller . AMD has carved out a niche in AI inference, which is expected to become the much larger market over time .  AMD says one of the largest AI model companies is now using its GPUs to handle a significant share of its daily inference traffic . Major cloud computing providers are also turning to AMD's GPUs to power search, recommendations, and generative AI tasks .  AMD has become a leader in the market for data center central processing units (CPUs) AMD should continue to see solid overall data center CPU growth as AI infrastructure spending continues to increase . Broadcom is both a hardware and software AI growth story .  AI networking revenue jumped 170% last quarter and now makes up 40% of its AI revenue .

" This company is not a quantum computing pure play, but has invested in refining the technology . Pure-play quantum computing companies face financial challenges that could diminish their ability to drive long-term returns . This tech giant can likely invest whatever is necessary to succeed in quantum computing .  Google-parent Alphabet generated more than $90 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2025 . The company generated over 99% of that revenue from its digital advertising businesses and Google Cloud . The technology has no representation in the company's financial statements .  Rigetti Computingreported a similar story, with revenue of $1.5 million falling far short of the $22.1 million in operating expenses . Even with gains on the fair value of warrant liabilities, it still lost $38.3 million . In contrast, Alphabet does not have funding issues, with $95.7 billion in liquidity and $19 billion in free cash flow .  Willow quantum computing chip recently completed a benchmark computation in less than five minutes . That same computation would take 10 septillion (1025) years on a traditional supercomputer, a time period well over the estimated age of the universe . Willow will likely develop and release improved versions of the chip over time .  Alphabet does not mention quantum computing in its earnings releases, nor does it report any revenue or funding tied to that technology . However, Alphabet's free cash flows from other businesses have funded initiatives such as quantum computing . That gives the company ample resources to refine Willow's technology continually .  The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years .

" William Tunstall-Pedoe started pushing the boundaries on what's possible with machines as a 13-year-old schoolboy . He secretly helped create and launch Amazon’s Alexa over a decade ago . His anagram technology was used by author Dan Brown for the Da Vinci Code .  It is 20 years since he started his search and voice recognition company, True Knowledge . Evi Technologies was sold to Amazon in 2012 for a reported £21m . Tunstall-Pedoe charts the company as a 10-year adventure .  Evi pivoted several times as a start-up, from a search engine that answered questions to producing a voice assistant, launching at the same time as Apple’s Siri . Evi was tackling the problem of how to use language to interact with machines, which of course is incredibly topical now .  Unlikely AI is developing technology that combines LLMs with symbolic methods to make AI safer for companies in sectors such as healthcare . 30-strong Cambridge outfit had multiple acquisition offers before working on secret project for Amazon, now known as Alexa, which went to market in late 2014 .  Thus Unlikely AI was born to earn trust and solve complex issues with its deep learning software . Tunstall-Pedoe says LLMs are designed to be accurate and explainability and auditability .  I built a database of millions of facts about the world, where the system could make sense and reason with them . I thought it would be interesting to do an analysis of all the facts that the system knew, and in particular with the goal of finding what the least interesting date in history was — 11 April 1954 . The story went so viral that it got told and retold and it’s had new life ever since .  You can have 100 million users within a couple of months if you create a really successful piece of software, which is kind of almost impossible in almost any other industry . That's what's exciting about it, that potential for big impact if you're developing technology that really hits home .",neutral,"alexa, ai, siri, assistant, evi"

" Google, the largest customer of Scale AI, plans to cut ties with Scale after news broke that rival Meta is taking a 49% stake in the AI data-labeling startup . Google had planned to pay Scale AI about $200 million this year for human-labeled training data that is crucial for developing technology .  Scale AI raked in $870 million in revenue in 2024, and Google spent some $150 million on Scale AI's services last year, sources said . Other major tech companies that are customers of Scale's, includingMicrosoft, are also backing away .  Meta now taking a 49% stake, AI companies are concerned that one of their chief rivals could gain knowledge about their business strategy and technical blueprints . Business with Scale could expose their research priorities and road map to a rival, five sources said .  Scale also does data-labeling for enterprises like self-driving car companies and the U.S. government . Google had already sought to diversify its data service providers for more than a year . Meta's moves this week have led Google to seek to move off Scale AI on all its key contracts, sources say .  Meta deal will be a boon for Scale AI's investors including Accel and Index Ventures . Many AI labs now want to hire in-house data-labelers, which allows their data to remain secure . Scale AI provides vast amounts of labeled data or curated training data .  Meta is fighting the perception that it may have fallen behind in the AI race . Its initial set of Llama 4 large language models released in April fell short of performance expectations .",negative,"ai, scale, enterprises, investors, revenue"
" Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the company's robotaxi test will start on June 22, later than expected . A betting site lists only a 30% chance that Tesla launches the service before July . Goldman analyst estimates the market for traditional ride-hailing in the US isworth approximately $58 billion .

Waymo to maintain a strong presence in the market and adapt to different vehicle platforms . Autonomous expert Katie Driggs-Campbell of the University of Illinois’ Grainger College of Engineering agrees . Waymo also touts its safety record, as well as how open it's been with data .  Tesla’s current FSD (full self-driving) and robotaxi software use only a vision-based system powered by a neural network “brain” that is constantly training itself using videos collected by millions of Tesla vehicles . Tesla hasreportedlyasked the city of Austin to block release of safety records related to its roboticaxi launch .  Waymo’s self-driving tech and sensors reportedly cost $100,000 plus the cost of the vehicle itself . Tesla, meanwhile, has the ability to produce 2 million or more electric vehicles a year .  Tesla is looking to win with more vehicles with targeted data specific to their vision-only approach . Xiaomi is also testing autonomous driving in China, but the company has suffered from safety issues in early trials .  Waymo is adding more cities to its list of current operations, with Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C., coming online in 2026 . Waymo's technological lead and strong backing from Alphabet clearly have the service in pole position .",neutral,"tesla, roboticaxi, robotaxi, waymo, driven"

" Apple has set an internal release target of spring 2026 for its delayed upgrade of Siri . The Siri team is aiming to bring the revamped voice assistant to market as part of an iOS 26.4 software update . The long-promised changes will allow Siri to tap into consumers’ personal data and on-screen activities .  Apple hasn’t announced exact timing for the new Siri features, people say . The upgrade has been a long time coming . The idea was to modernize the voice assistant, first introduced in 2011 .  Apple has gone nearly two years between announcing the new Siri and delivering it to customers . It's been an especially high-profile delay because the capabilities were part of the iPhone 16 marketing last year . Internally, Apple’s AI and marketing teams have pointed fingers at each other .  Apple has been pushing Siri features for iOS 18.4 and iOS 8.5 . The company had been expected to be released in fall of 2024 and spring of 2025 . The delays stemmed from engineering snags that kept Siri from working properly a third of the time .  Giannandrea kept a low profile at Apple's latest developer event this week . He's also less influential internally, according to people with knowledge of the matter . Engineering for Siri was taken over by Vision Pro headset creator Mike Rockwell and software engineering chief Craig Federighi .  Apple announced a sweeping design overhaul for all of its platforms this week . It didn't introduce major in-house AI features beyond opening its large language models to developers and adding live translation to calls and text messages . It also didn’t introduce or demonstrate Siri features, though Federighi did address the delay .  Apple has been working on an even more ambitious Siri revamp . This would turn the assistant into an always-on device copilot that’s more conversational . Apple also has teams exploring a chatbot-like app dubbed Knowledge that can tap into the open web .  The CEO was removed from his responsibilities during the shake-up earlier this year . That has spurred concerns within the company over whether his team is up to the latest challenge .",neutral,"siri, ios, iphone, voice, apple"

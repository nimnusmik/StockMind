" Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia are turning AI investments into concrete results . Artificial intelligence has helped these companies grow their profit margins . All three stocks sport reasonable valuations despite being around all-time highs .  The longer users stay on Meta's Family of Apps, the more attractive those platforms become for advertisers . Microsoft has integrated AI across its Microsoft 365 suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, etc.) through an AI feature called Copilot .  Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia all have multiple ways to grow earnings . Nvidia is the undisputed leader in providing a full stack of AI computing solutions . Meta has steadily increased its advertising revenue and profitability .  Nvidia's sky-high operating margins have helped the company convert a substantial amount of revenue into profit . But competition or a slowdown in AI spending may lead to margin erosion over time . Nvidia has transformed its business from relying largely on gaming, professional visualization, cryptocurrency, and other end markets to being a data center-focused business .  Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia all sport surprisingly reasonable valuations . Most of the Magnificent Seven have forward price-to-earnings ratios in the mid-20s to mid-30s . Nvidia's 51.7% profit margin means that it converts over half of every dollar in sales into pure net income .  Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia stand out as long-term winners due to their established and industry-leading business models . However, these stocks are not cheap . A growth slowdown could make any of these stocks appear more expensive in the near term .  The Motley Fool is issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies .

" Investors are rewarding big tech companies that are monetizing AI . Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet could be coiled springs for long-term growth . Investors may be souring onTesla,Apple, andAlphabet due to their apparent lack of AI achievements .  Tesla stock popped after its robotaxi event showcased progress on self-driving cars . Tesla could benefit from AI one day, but it isn't monetizing it to a significant extent right now . Apple hasn't made meaningful AI improvements to its product suite .  AI presents arguably the best opportunity in decades for competition to tap into Apple's dominant smartphone market share . Apple has grown increasingly dependent on sales outside the U.S., but has been losing market share in key markets like China due to intense competition from companies like Xiaomi, Huawei, and Vivo .  Alphabet-owned generative AI model Gemini can work with text, audio, visuals, video, and even code . Google Search is facing its biggest challenge in decades from competitors' AI-powered search offerings . The elephant in the room is uncertainty about how AI could affect Google Search .  Tesla is arguably the highest-risk name given its lofty valuation . But Apple and Alphabet both have more reasonable valuations (31.2 P/E for Apple and 18.6 for Alphabet) These companies generate a ton of free cash flow and earnings that they can use to reinvest in the business .  Short-term-minded investors may pass on Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet simply because they aren't proven AI plays . But all three stocks could still be worth buying and holding for long-term investors . Apple and Alphabet present far more compelling risk and potential reward profiles than Tesla .  On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a“Double Down” stockrecommendation for companies that they think are about to pop .

" WhatsApp is now banned from government phones in the U.S. House of Representatives . The move came after the CAO’s Office of Cybersecurity deemed the Meta-owned app to be “high-risk to users” While WhatsApp is one of the more secure messaging apps, it does have some privacy and security risks .  Office of Cybersecurity had announced a ban on WhatsApp this week came fromAxios . The memo stipulated that “House staff are NOT allowed to download or keep the WhatsApp application on any House device, including any mobile, desktop, or web browser versions of its products”  WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted, meaning no parties other than the ones in the chat, even including Meta, can read the messages . WhatsApp collects a lot more metadata from each chat than other secure messaging apps do, and it sends this info to Meta A chat’s metadata can include the identities of the chat participants, IP addresses, phone numbers, and timestamps of messages .  WhatsApp chats are end-to-end encrypted, but if a user backs up those chats to cloud storage accounts like Google Drive or iCloud, the backup itself is not encrypted by default . This means that if a bad actor gains access to a WhatsApp user's third-party cloud storage provider of choice, they could obtain the unencrypted backup and read all of that user’s messages . WhatsApp also doesn’t have other advanced privacy and security features enabled by default, including the ability to lock the app behind biometrics and requiring two-step verification when a WhatsApp account is installed on another phone .  Meta designs WhatsApp so that the metadata is sent directly to the company . There’s no way you can turn this data collection off . But you can make WhatsApp more secure on your phone by following some simple steps .  WhatsApp has been banned by the CAO of the House of Representatives . The CAO said it is monitoring and analyzing for potential cybersecurity risks . You should still set up the optional two-step verification for your account .  The Office of Cybersecurity has banned or imposed partial bans on various foreign apps . The CAO has also previously announced bans or restrictions on apps made by American companies . A spokesperson for WhatsApp said it disagrees with the CAO's characterization of WhatsApp in the strongest possible terms .  WhatsApp, consider enhancing the privacy and security it already offers by enabling the optional protections described above . WhatsApp is a popular messaging service that allows users to use it anonymously .",negative,"whatsapp, encrypted, security, privacy, icloud"

" Meta Platforms' advertising success has enabled it to deliver impressive gains . The stock should have tremendous growth prospects over the next 10 years, thanks largely to AI . Meta faces regulatory and competitive challenges, but should remain a winner for investors .  In March 2025, an average of 3.43 billion people used at least one of Meta's four key apps daily . That represents nearly 42% of the world's population . This audience is becoming increasingly valuable to advertisers, too .  Meta Platforms stock is still a screaming buy because the company has tremendous growth prospects over the next 10 years . Much of this growth will come from advertising .

Zuckerberg said in Q1 earnings call, ""Glasses are the ideal form factor for both AI and the metaverse"" Regulatory agencies in various countries could slow Meta's growth . I predict that Meta's smart (internet-connected) devices will become increasingly important to its success .  Meta could still be forced to modify its model somewhat to comply with DMA. decision.

Microsoft’s defensive qualities have stood out for decades as a stock that rarely underperforms .  Microsoft posted an impressive 46% operating margin, putting it among the most efficient companies globally .

Microsoft’s scale and complexity make a figure like 59% even more impressive and sustainable over time .

" President Donald Trump said he was ending all trade discussions with Canada in retaliation for the country’s digital services tax . Trump threatened to impose a fresh tariff rate within the next week . Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects the administration will launch a so-called Section 301 investigation into Canada .  Canada and the US have one of the world’s largest bilateral trading relationships . The alliance has grown tense since Trump won the election . He has threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and said he thinks it should become the 51st US state .  Shares of companies that rely on moving goods across the border also took a hit . Dozens of countries face a July 9 deadline for Trump’s higher tariffs to kick back into place . That deadline doesn’t apply to Canada and Mexico .  Ontario Premier Doug Ford reiterates his call for the prime minister to abandon the digital tax . Canada’s digital services tax isn’t new . It was passed into law a year ago .  A group of 21 US lawmakers wrote to Trump earlier this month asking him to push for the tax’s removal . Trump has long railed against taxes and other non-tariff barriers, casting them as an impediment to US exporters . Business groups had warned it would increase the cost of services and invite retaliation by the US .  The levy is 3% of the digital services revenue that a firm makes from Canadian users above C$20 million ($14.6 million) in a year .

" President Trump has announced that the U.S. will cease all trade talks with Canada in response to the Canadian government seeking to impose what amounts to unfair taxes on technology platforms, including Meta . Back in 2023, Canadian officials introduced the“Online News Act,” which is ostensibly designed to address imbalances in the local news ecosystem, by forcing large online platforms, like Meta and Google, to pay Canadian publishers .  Canadian government introduced 'Digital Services Tax' in order to deal with digital services operating in the region that bring in more than $20 million per annum . That means that Meta, even if it isn’t using local news publisher content, will still have to pay to operate in Canada . Trump has responded with reciprocal penalties for what he sees as penalties that unfairly target U.S. tech platforms .  The White House will let Canada know the tariff that they’ll have to pay “to do business with the United States” within seven days . Trump also announced that the White House is terminating all discussions on trade with Canada, effective immediately .  Meta blocked news in its apps in Canada almost two years ago, and that the Digital Services Tax was announced last year . Zuckerberg and Co. have sought to cosy up to the second Trump Administration in order to call on the White House to push back against penalties like this .  Zuckerberg says the U.S. technology industry is “a bright spot in the American economy,” and as such it’s of strategic advantage for the government to defend that . The Trump administration has flagged that it will take a stand against EU regulations .  The Canadian government has suspended its Digital Services Tax for the time being, in order to advance trade negotiations with the U.S. for tech regulations . But it’s the EU rules that Meta really wants the White House to push back on .",negative,"tariff, canadian, taxes, tax, canada"

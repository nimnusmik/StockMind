" Marketing expenses are often some of the tightest line items of a company's budget . Using AI as a copilot for concepting, building and targeting campaigns may greatly boost efficiency . This kind of tech can also simplify a major lift for startups or smaller companies .  AI still has accuracy and hallucination issues, which cause problems if it’s used to automate creative parts of advertising . Problems can increase substantially if a model veers into false advertising .  AI has a tendency to amplify biases it picks up in training and when it’s used in advertising, that may lead to unknowing reinforcement of stereotypes for certain groups . The move represents a major shift in who has creative control, said Mandell. “Delegating creative and strategic choices to an opaque system means losing visibility and potentially, accountability,” she said .  Enterprises also need to be able to identify when AI makes mistakes and catch them before they’re released to customers . “The line should be drawn at the erosion of human judgment,” said Mandell .",negative,"ai, advertising, marketing, enterprises, campaigns"

" Meta Platforms Inc.’s flashy deal this week for nuclear power was just the latest sign of the technology industry's need for more energy . While the top US reactor companies are eager to sign more contracts, the big question remains: Will new generation come online quickly enough?  It's been more than a decade since the US last broke ground on a large-scale nuclear power plant that came online . Nuclear is especially well suited for technology companies with ambitious climate goals because it's a clean-energy source .  Power demand in the US is expected to soar as much as 15% in some regions by the end of the decade . Texas alone has said it will need the equivalent of 30 conventional nuclear reactors to meet the growing demand from AI .  Algorithms that were developed in the early 2020s are being deployed now, with the goal of testing and perfecting the models’ ability to think and solve problems . More nuclear may be available, but not until “the tail end of the first wave,” Alam says .  Meta is also planning upgrades at several existing plants that could add the equivalent of an entire new reactor . The company says it has a lot of capacity that would be available to customers . But analysts say it's not clear that will be enough for the next several years .  Bloomberg L.P. use a $400 billion green bank to finance billions of dollars in loans for projects including nuclear reactors . Even if a major new nuclear plant went into construction immediately, it would likely be years before it would be able to send electricity to data centers .",positive,"reactors, reactor, nuclear, upgrades, generation"
" Meta Platforms and CrowdStrike are stock-split candidates in 2025 after experiencing tremendous share price appreciation during the last three years . Stocks that split have historically outperformed theS&P 500 by 13 percentage points during the year after the split announcement .

CrowdStrike is the market leader in managed detection and response, a service that lets companies outsource their cybersecurity needs to trained professionals .

" As of the end of March, a mix of four well-known AI hardware and applications companies made up roughly 30% of Coatue Management's invested assets . The deadline for institutional investors overseeing at least $100 million in assets to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange is May 15 .  Coatue Management's Philippe Laffont ended March with $22.7 billion in assets under management . He leans heavily into growth stocks and companies riding the latest technological waves, such as the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution .  In four of the last five quarters, social media titan Meta Platforms has been billionaire Philippe Laffont's top holding . Coatue's more than 3.75-million-share stake equated to almost $2.2 billion in market value at the end of March .  Meta Platforms also has the luxury of an enviable treasure chest . Its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities collectively topped $70 billion at the end of March . Amazon has been a top-four holding for Coatue Management since the start of 2024 .  Amazon Web Services (AWS) is pacing $117 billion in annual run-rate revenue . AWS entered 2025 accounting for a 33% share of global cloud infrastructure service spending . Amazon's other high-growth ancillary segments are playing key roles in its growth .  The third largest holding in Philippe Laffont's fund for a second consecutive quarter is world-leading chip fabrication companyTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing . TSMC is in the process of increasing its CoWoS capacity from around 35,000 units per month in 2024 to 135,000 wafers per month by 2026 .  Laffont's sizable wager on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing might also have to do with it building advanced-chip production facilities in the U.S. President Trump's threat of imposing tariffs on imports, including the possibility of tariffs, is more of a moot point with TSMC investing in America . The fourth AI stock that accounts for about 30% of Coatue Management's $22.7 billion in invested assets is Microsoft .  Microsoft is aggressively deploying generative AI and LLM tools in its cloud infrastructure service platform . Microsoft's legacy operations aren't slouches, either . Even though the growth heyday for Windows and Office is long gone, Microsoft's software still dominates .

The technology sector has witnessed an abnormal level of interest compared to other industries . The AI theme can largely be traced to asmall concentration of megacap stocks known as the ""Magnificent Seven""  As of May 1, Nvidia is the third-largest company in the world measured by market cap . The company's current market cap is nearly $1 trillion lower than peak levels seen in January . The first large-scale sell-off in Nvidia stock happened earlier this year, after a Chinese start-up emerged out of nowhere .  The current sell-off in Nvidia revolves around a nasty storm related to new tariff policies . I see Nvidia as a more critical player to the development of AI-powered services compared to Apple and Microsoft .

Nvidia should witness strong demand for its GPUs and various other services throughout the second half of the year .  Nvidia: If you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009,you’d have $296,928!

" X has added new sports engagement elements to its game-day app . X has been working on this since November last year, when it launched its new“NFL Portal” element . The NFL Portal brings together posts from NFL teams, as well as key commentators, while also providing access to game schedules, live scores and stats .  X users can also dock conversations about a live match, so they can keep on top of the discussion while X’s video feed provides another means to share highlights in-stream . Meta already has a deal in place with the UFC, which will see exclusive, live content shared to Threads .  Threads hosted a live chat with ESPN’s Malika Andrewsto promote the NBA Finals . Threads is looking to make inroads with this key discussion element, as another effort to put pressure on X . The fact that X is now looking to add more sports engagement elements suggests that Threads likely is making some progress .  X is putting too much reliance on its Grok AI chatbot to drive engagement . LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky noted that LinkedIn’s AI-generated post creation tools aren’t catching on as it had hoped they would .  X’s continued push on Grok could lead to the same, and it’ll be interesting to see how the platform looks to counter engagement losses with more features designed to enhance the user experience .

" Bitcoin's long-held belief as a major volatile asset has been challenged amid the Iran-Israel conflict . On June 21, the United States carried out a strike on Iran, where it bombed three of its main nuclear facilities . Bitcoin's 60-day realized volatility had fallen to approximately 27% to 28%, according to Bitwise Europe's André Dragosch .

" The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks have generated impressive returns for long-term investors . But after years of big gains, most of the Magnificent Seven stocks are losing their luster . Apple is still overwhelmingly dependent on the iPhone, Amazon faces stiff competition from cheaper cross-border competitors .  Meta and Nvidia face fewer near-term headwinds than the other five stocks . Meta generates nearly all of its revenue from ads, and growth could slow down as the global economy cools off . Nvidia isn't immune to economic downturns and recessions, but expansion of its AI chipmaking business could offset that pressure .  Nvidia once generated most of its revenue from its gaming GPUs . But in its latest quarter, 89% came from its data center GPUs . Data center GPUs are better suited for processing complex AI tasks than stand-alone CPUs .  Analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings per share to grow at compound annual growth rates of 30% and 28% from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028 . Nvidia has comfortably beat Wall Street's top- and bottom-line expectations for nine consecutive quarters . Its stock still looks reasonably valued relative to those estimates at 36 times forward earnings .  Nvidia locks in customers with its proprietary Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programming platform . Developers write their AI applications on CUDA, they become optimized for Nvidia's GPUs and can only be executed on its chips . That stickiness widens its moat againstAMDand other challengers .  The Motley Fool’s total average return is994% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to172% for the S&P 500 .

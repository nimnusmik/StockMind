" There have been more than 140 ‘ghost’ stores operating online in Australia falsely marketing themselves as local brands and selling everything from poor quality clothing to counterfeit sports labels . TheAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission is investigating after a surge of complaints about ghost stores .  Analysis shows the number of misleading sites and threats to Australian consumers is far more prevalent than previously known . Experts say the sites should be subject to Australian consumer law because they advertise on social media locally . Many websites use very similar copy, sell similar products, and reuse email addresses .  Online store claims to be ‘based in Lennik, Belgium’ on its website . It lists an address for a house 30 minutes from Brussels but also says ‘some of our products are located and shipped from within Australia, while others are shipped from China’ The returns form for a third site instructs the customer to pay return postage to address in Zhejiang, China .  A 60-year-old Brisbane woman spent about $350 on shoes and clothing from the site last year after seeing their advertising on Facebook . She says she received the items, but they were “rubbish” after trying to arrange a refund . The woman said the company sent PayPal the details of their refund process, which listed the Zhejiang address and instructed her to make a false customs declaration .  Running list of sites compiled by the Scam Alerts Australia Facebook group – have been built using the Shopify e-commerce platform . The Consumer Policy Research Centre said online platforms must do more to stop ‘fraudulent players’ from using their services .  Meta used a “combination of technology and human reviewers” to process reports . “It’s a huge problem that they’re not taking any responsibility for and that's terrible” Cullin says .",negative,"fraudulent, shopify, commerce, scam, counterfeit"

" The S&P 500 Index closed out the week on its longest winning streak in more than 20 years . It recouped all of its losses since April 2, when President Donald Trump launched his global trade war . Wall Street’s institutional money staying on the sidelines, bullish individual investors are driving the gains .  The fundamentals behind the enthusiasm are less than promising . Economic data has been uneven, as the impact of Trump’s sweeping tariffs is only starting to hit . “Am I siding with the retail investors here right now? I might be.”  Companies reluctant to give hard outlooks for the rest of the year with so much uncertainty in the global economy . Amazon.com and Apple indicated that trade pressures are starting to hit .  The latest rebound is largely driven by the same retail trading cohort that has bought the dips in recent bull markets . Mom-and-pop investors snapped up $40 billion worth of US equities in April, a record for monthly inflows .  America Corp. have been buyers for 19 consecutive weeks, the longest streak to start a year in the firm’s data going back to 2008 . The sentiment among institutional investors has only slightly improved, shifting from significantly underweight US stocks to neutral .  Overall, the earnings guidance from Corporate America is the worst since the pandemic, according to Bloomberg Intelligence chief equity strategist Gina Martin Adams . Things are sketchy on the tariff front, where the real tensions are with China . Chinese state media said the Trump administration has reached out to initiate talks, but it appears the tough stance has only strengthened China’s resolve to fight .  The Trump administration says it’s close to some kind of resolution with India, Japan and South Korea . Even if an agreement in principle is reached, it will likely take months or years to hammer out the final terms . US consumer sentiment is among the lowest going back to the 1970s .  “The soft data that has been envisioning a sharp economic downturn I think is going to quickly turn into hard data,” said chief market strategist at StoneX Group . “Even if we get a trade agreement, I think volatility affects sentiment, consumption and investment”",negative,"investors, stocks, markets, investment, market"

The company beat forecasts, with revenue of US$42b, some 2.3% above estimates, and statutory earnings per share (EPS) came in at US$6.43, 23% ahead of expectations . Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus is for revenues of US $187.0b in 2025 .  Meta Platforms has seen a notable 9.7% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months . Statutory earnings per share are expected to reduce 3.4% to US$25.60 in the same period . The consensus price target was unchanged at US$706, implying that the improved earnings outlook is not expected to have a long term impact on value creation .  Meta Platforms revenue forecast to display 13% growth on an annualised basis in the period to end of 2025 . That is in line with its 15% annual growth over the past five years . By contrast, other companies in similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 10% per year .  There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates . We still think that the longer term trajectory is much more important for investors to consider . That said, it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk .  Simply Wall St. does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your financial situation .

" The stock market's crazy first five months of 2025 have left Wall Street pros in a pickle . The benchmark is basically flat for 2025 and putting up one of its worst starts to a year since the 1950s . It's also getting handily beaten by stock markets around the world .  Over the past 30 years, the S&P’s average return is roughly flat for June, as much of Wall Street begins its summer holiday season . Corporate executives are as pessimistic as they’ve been since 2022, according to a recent CEO confidence survey .  The S&P 500’s 19% plunge from its Feb. 19 record pushed it into a correction in just 16 trading days and brought it to the brink of a bear market . But after its almost 19% rebound since then, equity valuations have gotten much more stretched . US stocks are trailing the MSCI All Country World Index excluding the US Index by 12 percentage points in 2025 .  Historically, the third year of a US bull market, like now, is the weakest . Since World War II, the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of just 5.2% in year three . Since 1947, bull markets have averaged 55 months .  The market’s best performing sector this year is industrials, an optimistic sign for shares and growth . Defensive plays like utilities and consumer staples companies are also atop the leader board . Consumer discretionary shares that house some of the biggest retailers, homebuilders and automakers are among the worst performers this year .  In post-US presidential election years over the past seven decades, the S&P 500 has struggled in early June as investors booked profits heading into the summer . This is particularly true if the index gets a strong boost in May, like it did this year with a 6.2% jump .",negative,"markets, stocks, 2025, stock, market"
" Germany is reportedly contemplating imposing a 10% tax on major online platforms, including Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. Wolfram Weimer, the new German Minister of State for Culture, disclosed this proposal in an interview with Stern magazine . President Donald Trump has previously expressed his disapproval of foreign governments taxing American companies .  Weimer suggested that these companies generate billions in profits in Germany, contribute minimally to the country’s tax base and society . He also criticized the monopolistic tendencies of these digital platforms, arguing that they pose a threat to freedom of expression .  The shares of Alphabet fell 0.24% to close at $172.96 on Thursday, meanwhile Meta rose 0.23% to $645.05 . If the German government proceeds with this tax, it would join Britain, Italy, France, Spain, Turkey, India, Austria, and Canada, which have imposed similar taxes .  On Thursday, the company announced its first day of trading in the U.S. stock market . The company is expected to release a full range of new products on Thursday .",neutral,"tax, taxes, german, germany, austria"
" Meta Platforms is the parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram . The tech giant's stock is only valued on its legacy business . Patient investors should be rewarded as these efforts progress .  Meta is valued based on what it's doing now, but some of the investments it's making could transform the company . CEO Mark Zuckerberg has claimed that AI has become so advanced that sometime this year, AI will be able to code at the same capacity as a mid-level software engineer .  Zuckerberg thinks ad-related revenue will become a much larger part of global GDP . Zuckerberg estimated that more than a billion people already wear glasses today, which is a massive market opportunity for Meta to capture should its AI glasses become a hit .  Meta Platforms' stock is only priced based on its legacy ad business, not any of its AI-powered upside . Advertising tends to be a poor business in economic downturns, and it's unknown how all the uncertainty caused by tariffs will affect the ad market moving forward . Advertising markets tend to bounce back stronger after a downturn .  Meta Platforms isn't one of The Motley Fool's best stocks to buy now . With the stock priced at about the same level it has been for previous years, now seems like a solid time to buy the stock . Investors should see a significant return on their investment due to the improvements they're implementing .  Randi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors . out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Fool's Stock Advisor Stock Show .",positive,"advertising, meta, market, zuckerberg, platforms"

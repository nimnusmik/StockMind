The JCT has estimated the provision will bring in $116.3 billion in revenue .  Section 899 would ultimately lower annual US tax revenues by $12.9 billion in 2033 and 2034, committee says .

" X is moving ahead with its overhaul of messaging in the app . Some users are now able to access the initial beta of X’s updated “Chat” element . X is rebuilding its DM back-end with enhanced privacy in mind, with encryption being a foundational element .  X owner Elon Musk recently reiterated his plans to move in this direction . The focus on using messaging for this purpose also fits with Elon’s broader vision to create a Western version of WeChat .  Facebook Pay is the only element still remaining from this effort, with regulatory challenges and low consumer adoption . Even Facebook Pay has struggled to gain any real traction, though that also relates to broader concerns around Meta’s past data privacy controversies, and industry stonewalling to stop Meta becoming an even bigger player in another key market .  X has struggled to gain payment processor licenses in the U.S., with key statesrefusing its initial applicationsdue to concerns around its ownership . Western users have generally seemed more content to keep their social media and shopping experiences separate .  New York rejected X’s initial payment processing request, based on the fact that X has ties with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, due to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman being an investor in the X project . X still hasn’t even looked to expand to other nations as yet .  Users may well be the most difficult part, because X is losing them over time . Even if X can get all the necessary approvals (which no other app has been able to), it’s audience share may soon be so small that it won’t matter either .",neutral,"messaging, facebook, privacy, chat, payment"
" Buried deep in the more than 1,000-page tax-and-spending bill that President Trump is muscling through Congress is an obscure tax measure . The measure calls for, among other things, increasing tax rates for individuals and companies from countries that the US deems “discriminatory” The item was introduced in legislation that passed the House last week .  If signed into law, it would further drive away foreign investors at a time when their once ironclad confidence in US assets has already been shaken by Trump’s erratic trade policies . “We’re already dealing with a market where Treasuries, to foreign investors, probably aren’t the most attractive investment,” said Michael Brown, a strategist .  The proposed tax is separate from Trump’s tariff-heavy trade agenda, which is now snarled in court . Experts fear the consequences of Section 899 may be far-reaching . The provision amounts to “weaponization of US capital markets into law”  Section 899 takes aim at countries including Canada, UK, France and Australia that impose “digital services taxes” on large technology companies such as Meta Platforms Inc. Morgan Stanley’s strategists included the provision in frequently asked questions related to the tax-and-spending bill .  The section 899 provision could add to the pressure on long-term interest rates . Tariffs are considered a key source of revenue to fund Trump’s tax cuts . Without them, the question is where the administration will find the money to fund them .  The White House Council of Economic Advisers called for imposing ‘user fees’ on foreign investors in US Treasuries . The move is designed to give Trump a negotiation tool for pressuring countries to drop digital services taxes .  Section 899 is likely to remain in the final version of the reconciliation package, which is now being reviewed in Senate . Still, US assets as a whole have been underperformers this year . The S&P 500 is up about 0.4% this year, compared with a 20% gain in the German benchmark and 18% rally in Hong Kong .  President's viewpoint is that there is such immense foreign appetite to invest in the US that it is not at risk of being thrown off course, according to Charles Myers, a former Wall Street executive who runs advisory firm Signum . Pepperstone’s Brown says investors hadn’t fully grasped the significance of the clause . “People are thinking that maybe there are some things lurking under the surface of the bill we should pay a little bit more attention to,” said Brown .

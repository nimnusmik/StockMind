" The social platform X will pilot a feature that allows AI chatbots to generate Community Notes . Community Notes is a Twitter-era feature that Elon Musk has expanded under his ownership of the service . Users who are part of this fact-checking program can contribute comments that add context to certain posts .  AI notes can be generated using X’s Grok or by using other AI tools and connecting them to X via an API . Any note that an AI submits will be treated the same as a note submitted by a person, which means that it will go through the same vetting process to encourage accuracy .  There is still a risk to relying too heavily on AI, especially since users will be able to embed LLMs from third parties . X plans to test these AI contributions for a few weeks before rolling them out more broadly if they're successful . Users shouldn’t expect to see AI-generated Community Notes yet .",neutral,"chatbots, notes, ai, twitter, note"

Professional services firms seem to be finding a return on their AI investment at a higher rate than in other sectors . Thomson Reuters found it was the professional firms where AI usage was part of a well-defined strategy and that had implemented AI governance structures were the most likely to see gains .  Businesses enact high-minded ‘Responsible AI’ principles but then the teams building or deploying AI products struggle to operationalize them . This gap means that teams building AI applications may not have visibility into the data used to train a model they are deploying or detailed information about how it may perform .  Is everyone in the business aligned about why AI is being used in the first place? Is it for human augmentation or automation? Is the goal to be more accurate than a human, or simply to come close to human performance at a lower cost? What role should environmental sustainability play in these decisions?  KPMG had a policy of not deploying AI in situations that called for human judgment . Auditing is full of such cases, such as deciding on materiality thresholds . Many corporate legal departments are embracing AI faster than legal firms .  Corporate counsel are demanding that external lawyers be more transparent about their AI usage . Many legal tasks can now be done in far fewer billable hours . AI is also possibly going to change how professional service firms think about career paths within their business .

" Microsoft is leading big tech and has the best near-term outlook for the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks . Motley Fool analyst Nick Sciple and host Dylan Lewis discuss: Microsoftposting double-digit growth across five segments . David Zaslav is the man tasked with leading the media conglomerate into the future .  The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years . Consider when Netflixmade this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $623,685!* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’’ total average return is906% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to164%for the S&P 500 .  Microsoft and Meta remind Wall Street that earnings power exists with their reports this week . We're seeing why big tech are the big dogs on the stock market, and seemingly immune to macroeconomic and consumer demand concerns .  Microsoft everywhere you look, Xbox, even at the Box Office this year have had some success . Cloud margins are under pressure because of that continued AI spin, but really, this is a big tech giant that continues to be a steam roller .  The company expects to have AI capacity constraints beginning in June of this year . Microsoft plans to spend as much as $80 billion this year on AI . Demand continues to outstrip supply .  There are five different segments for Microsoft that are posting double-digit revenue growth . Nick Sciple: Hard to see anywhere where there's really disappointment .  Meta is showing success across all metrics and guidance calls for more of that to come . Microsoft being one of these businesses, transitioning to AI business margins, reportedly better now than when Microsoft was at a similar stage .  Family daily active people reached $3.43 billion for the reported quarter . That's 60% of the world's total Internet population . Ad impressions, up 5% year over year, average price per ad, increased 10% .  Mark Zuckerberg said their long-term goal is to basically make it where any business can give us the objective they're trying to achieve, like selling something or reaching a new customer, and AI can just do the rest for you . Over the coming years, that increased productivity from AI is going to make advertising an even larger share of global GDP than it is today .  Management mentioned that on the call, we're also probably going to see a little bit of weakness from some Chinese retailers if the tariff situation holds up . That was some big worries that folks had called out leading into the earnings report . That said, if you look at revenue guidance for the quarter ahead, in line with expectations .  Mark Zuckerberg was quick to note improved advertising definitely one of the major opportunities that they see when it comes to artificial intelligence . He's got five that he sees in particular, advertising one, more engaging experience, business messaging, Meta AI, and AI devices .  Nick Sciple: The impact of AI is making the core advertising platform stronger . Dylan Lewis: I think I'm a near-term skeptic on the Ray-Ban glasses. I am more easily convinced that the Meta AI ambitions might turn into something for the business .  Meta AI already has over a billion monthly active users, if you include the users on Messenger, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, where it's really directly built in to the chat tool . Zuckerberg: Text-based chatbot is not what Zuckerberg sees as the end state for AI. I think he sees that as where we are today, but where things are headed .  Meta needs no introduction. It is an ad-based business that is stepping into a spot where, for the most part, consumers expect subscription models . I don't think this is the end of the road for where Meta is headed .  Meta is using incredible amounts of AI resources just for its core business . Dylan Lewis: ""I think long term, they are positioned to be a leader, even though today they're not the one that's front and center""  AI directly drives the growth of the core ads business, says Nick Sciple . Sciple: AI can let them lower the barrier to entry for creating ads and make those ads more efficacious and more targeted .  Zuckerberg wants to Meta AI glasses like Iron Man's JARVIS or what Apple always promised Siri could be, but never actually delivered . Zuckerberg said, ""This is the year where AI glasses go mainstream""  Microsoft is the only company in the Mag 7 year to date that is currently in the green . They don't have the antitrust issues that Alphabet has . They do not seem as subject to consumer spending and advertising as Amazon, Meta, and Apple .  As an enterprise software company, Microsoft is arguably the most insulated from tariff and economic uncertainty because its products are mission critical . Microsoft reportedly has reportedly begun developing its own internal AI models .  Microsoft and AI are like that couple that gets together in the first season of a sitcom, where you're like, ""This is either going to go really well and they're going to have to go their own when it comes to their AI aspirations .  Fundrise's flagship fund, a $1.1 billion real estate portfolio with more than 4,000 single family homes in the sunbelt communities, 3.3 million square feet of in-demand industrial facilities . The flagship fund taps into some of real estate's most attractive qualities .  Yasser El-Shimy and Mary Long talk about Warner Brothers Discovery . Mary Long: David Zaslav is the man tasked with leading the media conglomerate into the future . Visit fundrise.com/fool to explore the portfolio, check out historical returns .  Yasser El-Shimy: Mogul is definitely Zaslav's aspirational self . He is perceived by many artists as a slash-and-burn executive who's there to only focus on the bottom line, cut projects when they don't fit his view .  David Zaslav was a very successful CEO of Discovery, and he had turned Discovery into one of the most profitable businesses in the entertainment industry . He is not afraid to yank a project when he sees it as not having promise of being successful . He's also not shy away from licensing HBO content or other Warner Brothers' content to other distributors .  He doesn't shy away from licensing older content into other platforms likeNetflix, where you can watch Six Feet Under right now and so on. He does care about the bottom line. Doesn't necessarily make him the grim reaper for all artists in Hollywood, but he's definitely viewed with a lot of controversy .  Yasser El-Shimy: Zaslav seems to believe that it is his calling to save the media industry . He is, ""a man charged with leading the media business into the future, navigating the business out of its cultural, generational, and technological obsolescence""  David Zaslav is trying to salvage the film industry from going into obsolescence . He has to take on the likes of Alphabet and Amazon and Apple . He wants to recreate the magic that maybe Disney once had with the Marvel's Universe .  David Zaslav is the CEO of Warner Brothers Discovery . He has made a lot of money during his tenure as CEO, but the stock has not performed terribly well . He thinks franchising is going to be the future, and when you can find the hit, you just double down .  Yasser El-Shimy: Zaslav's pay package is tied to the generation of free cash flow, rather than to the stock price . He says it encourages him to do what he's been doing to pay down that hefty debt load, but also encourages these production funds that get a lot of pushback from the people that are actually making the films in the studio .  The company was born with a massive debt load that needed to be repaid almost immediately . To generate cash flow is to be able to manage that debt load and to pay it down year after year . As I said, he's taken down the leverage of the business from five times in debt to EBITDA to 3.8 right now .  Yasser El-Shimy: Just focus on the growth on the studio and streaming division . Mary Long: The best he can do there is to just manage that decline so that it's not a freefall .  The Motley Fool Money team includes Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet . Randi Zuckerberg is a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg .  Yasser El-Shimy has positions in Amazon, Microsoft, and Warner Bros. Discovery .

" Meta Platforms delivered 16% higher revenue -- but operating income soared 27% . The company increased its full-year capital expenditure guidance, and continues to deliver impeccable results . The stock has erased almost all of its year-to-date losses in recent weeks .  Meta finished the quarter with a sky-high operating margin of 41% . It converted 41 cents of every dollar in revenue into operating income . Manageable spending also led to a 35% increase in net income and a 37% jump in diluted earnings per share .  Meta is lowering its full-year guidance for total expenses from a range of $114 billion to $119 billion . The company is investing in infrastructure improvements (like building data centers) to scale up its AI services .  AI-driven feed and video recommendations delivered a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram . The Meta AI app is a stand-alone tool, which is different from embedded AI functionality in Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp .  Reality Labs is a money pit -- posting an operating loss of $4.2 billion in the quarter . In 2024, Reality Labslost a staggering $17.73 billion . In its latest quarter, Meta spent $13.4 billion on buybacks and $1.33 billion on dividends .  Meta has reduced its share count by 11.4% in just five years . If it were to sustain the same pace of buybacks and dividends for the whole year, it would return roughly 4% of its market cap to shareholders . Over time, buybacks have helped the company grow earnings far faster than net income .  Meta Platforms sports a P/E of just 22.4 -- which is dirt cheap for an industry-leading company with high margins . The core business continues to fire on all cylinders and generate plenty of cash flow to use for higher capex . The company continues to repurchase stock at a breakneck pace, keeping a tight lid on its valuation .  Meta Platforms wasn’t one of The Motley Fool’s top 10 best stocks for investors to buy now . Consider when Netflixmade this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $623,685!

" Meta can identify when users are feeling worthless or helpless, which it can use as a cue for advertisers . Former employee Sarah Wynn-Williams testified before the U.S. Senate about Meta's potentially intrusive data tracking .  Meta’s new AI chatbot uses your established history, based on your Facebook and Instagram profiles, to customize your chat experience . It also tracks every interaction that you have with the bot to further refine and improve its responses . Concerns have been raised as to the level at which it tracks user information .  Experts and analysts have been warning about this for years, but with Meta locking down its data, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it's faded as an issue . Meta has generally been able to avoid ongoing scrutiny for such, by, essentially, not talking about its tracking and predictive capacity . But there are plenty of examples that underline just how powerful Meta’s trove of user data can be .  Your Facebook activity does show who you are, whether you meant to share that or not . Facebook’s true strength in this sense, is scale . We’re just not confronted with it, outside of ad placements .  Meta AI now hosts increasingly personal chats on a broad range of topics . It has unmatched scale to crosscheck that data against, which gives it a huge amount of embedded understanding about user preferences, interests, leanings, etc. All of these could be used for ad targeting, content promotion and influence .  Meta's Advantage+ AI-powered ads are producing results, and as its AI tools get smarter, Meta’s going to get even better at knowing everything about you, as revealed by your Facebook and Instagram presence . But the pay-off here is that Meta will also use that understanding in ways you may not agree with .",negative,"meta, facebook, chatbot, profiles, ai"

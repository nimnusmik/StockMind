" Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, TSMC, and ASML are all strong plays on expanding AI infrastructure . Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are three tech titans set to benefit from AI . Palantir and Salesforce are two leading software companies that have big AI opportunities ahead .  AMD has become a leader in central processing units (CPUs), which act as the brains of the operation, within the data center . The company has also carved out a niche for its GPUs with AI inference, which is less technically demanding than training AI models .  Broadcom sees its three furthest-along customers as having between a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market in fiscal 2027 . This is a huge opportunity for Broadcom . While the above three companies design advanced AI chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSMC)is the one they hire to actually make them .  ASML has a virtual monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography . It also introduced its next-generation technology, high-NA (numerical aperture) EUV, that will allow for higher density chips . While TSMC has balked at the high price ($400 million) of these new machines, it cannot afford to get bypassed on the technological front by a competitor likeIntel .  Amazon is using AI throughout its e-commerce operations to make its business more efficient and reduce costs . Meta Platforms has been at the forefront of AI with its Llama large language model (LLM) Meta platforms are using AI to keep users more engaged on its social media apps .  Palantir Technologies has taken a different approach to AI, essentially looking to become the orchestration layer, or operating system, for the technology .

Salesforce is now looking to become the leader in agentic AI, where AI agents will go out and perform tasks with little to no human interaction .

" Three brand-name, non-tech stocks have completed forward splits in 2025 . The logical candidate to split its stock next is a cash cow with a sustainable moat whose shares are, once again, within a stone's throw of an all-time high .  Splits can move a company's share price up or down, but there's a sizable variance in how these two types of splits are perceived by the investing community . Reverse splits are often enacted by struggling companies that are attempting to avoid being delisted from a major stock exchange .  The ""Class of 2025"" stock-split stocks all come from outside the tech sector . Wholesale industrial and construction supplies company Fastenal was the first to cross the proverbial finish line by completing a 2-for-1 forward split after the close of trading on May 21 .  The third premier non-tech stock-split stock this year is automated electronic brokerage firmInteractive Brokers Group . O'Reilly's hub-and-spoke distribution model ensures that more than 153,000 stock keeping units (SKUs) can reach drivers and mechanics the same day or on an overnight basis .  Since 1980, companies have gained an average of 25.4% in the 12 months following their initial forward split announcement . In comparison, the S&P 500 has averaged an 11.9% increase over these same 12-month periods . Some companies with a high share price have demonstrated no interest in conducting a split .  Costco's membership-based model that keeps customers loyal to the brand is likely to see its share price extend well past $1,000 . Less than 20% of Netflix's shares are owned by non-institutional investors .  Social media giant Meta Platforms has never announced a stock split . Unlike Netflix, more than 27% of Meta's shares are held by everyday investors . In March, Meta had an average of 3.43 billion people visiting its family of apps daily . A forward split would also be a logical choice .  Mark Zuckerberg's company is sitting on a mountain of cash . It closed out the first quarter with more than $70 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities . Being a cash cow affords Meta the opportunity to aggressively invest in its AI-driven future . Best of all, Meta Platforms' stock remains reasonably inexpensive .  The case for Meta Platforms to become the highlight stock-split stock of 2025 grows stronger with each passing day . Consider when Netflixmade this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $664,089! The Motley Fool's total average return is994% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to172% for the S&P 500 .

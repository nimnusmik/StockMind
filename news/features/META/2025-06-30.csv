" AI developers won marginal legal battles this week when federal judges in California ruled that they could ""train"" large language models on copyrighted books . Dozens of copyright holders have sued developers, arguing that the developers must pay rights holders before allowing generative AI software to interpret their works for profit . Rights holders also argue that the AI output cannot resemble their original works .  Judge: Anthropic must face authors' claims that it infringed on their copyrights . The judge distinguished books that Anthropic paid for from a pirated library of more than 7 million books that it also used to train Claude . The rulings are among the first in the country to address emerging and unsettled questions over how far LLMs can go .  US copyright law gives creators exclusive right to reproductions, distributions, and public performances of their material . Experts say they expect the disputes will end up in appeals to the US Supreme Court .  Anthropic and Meta argued that training their LLMs on copyrighted material didn't violate the Copyright Act . Judge Alsup ruled Anthropic's use of books was ""exceedingly transformative"" and therefore qualified as fair use . Judge Chhabria criticized Alsup's ruling .  Anthropic still faces some other big legal challenges . Reddit sued the company earlier in June . The suit alleges Anthropic intentionally scraped Reddit users' personal data without consent .  If Anthropic were found liable for intentionally misusing the 7 million books at issue in its case, maximum allowable penalties could end up north of $1 trillion . Three authors brought the case, requesting that the court grant their request to pursue their claims as a class action . The judge's decision on the class certification request is pending .",negative,"copyrights, copyright, sued, law, disputes"

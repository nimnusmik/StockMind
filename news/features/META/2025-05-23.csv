" Two new locations entered Oxford Economics' global ranking of cities this year . The economic advisory firm's Global Cities Index scored the 1,000 largest cities across five categories: economics, human capital, quality of life, environment and governance . The significance of cities in this period of uncertainty can't be overstated .  French capital of Paris took over in third place this year from US city of San Jose, which fell to fourth spot . San Jose is renowned for the tech hub of Silicon Valley, which is home to big-name companies, including Apple and Google .  The US city of Seattle, which rounded out the top five, also boasts a major sector – with Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) operating in the area . The Australian cities of Melbourne and Sydney came in sixth and seventh place .  Several cities in India, Indonesia, and the UK have risen in the rankings this year, while Japanese, Canadian, and Brazilian cities mostly fell . Tokyo, Japan in ninth place and San Francisco in tenth spot .  Global Leaders are best positioned to maximise the benefits of generative AI but must address rising inequality . Developing Megacities have the potential for significant human capital growth but must overcome rapid urbanisation challenges .",negative,"cities, urbanisation, city, megacities, capital"
" OpenAI will acquire the AI device startup co-founded by Apple veteran Jony Ive in a nearly $6.5 billion all-stock deal . The purchase — the largest in OpenAI’s history — will provide the company with a dedicated unit for developing AI-powered devices . Acquiring the secretive startup, named io, also will secure the services of Ive and other former Apple designers .  Ive is embarking on a new collaboration with OpenAI with Altman . The British-born designer left Apple in 2019 . Altman said Jobs would be “damn proud” of Ive’s latest move .  As part of the deal, OpenAI is paying $5 billion in equity for io . Apple shares dropped as much as 2.3% in New York on Wednesday . The deal is expected to be completed this summer, pending regulatory approvals .  Ive and Altman’s first devices are slated to debut in 2026 . The pair expects their first device to be a truly novel type of product . Ive left Apple six years ago to start LoveFrom, a collective of designers and engineers .  Ive and Altman don’t see the iPhone disappearing anytime soon . The team will now continue that mission at OpenAI, becoming a threat to the very devices that the designers helped create .  Ive: People will connect with AI in “very new ways” with ChatGPT . The company’s valuation has swelled to $300 billion . OpenAI is working on a $3 billion deal for AI coding software company Windsurf .

The new team at OpenAI will work at io’s existing workspace in Jackson Square, a neighborhood in San Francisco . Ive and Altman wouldn’t elaborate on what hardware products they are working on . Meta Platforms Inc. is perhaps the most notable maker of AI devices .  Ive was central to developing every version of the iPhone within Apple’s hardware engineering department . Tan said the new team isn’t tied to a “legacy” and will have an opportunity to “rethink this space” Still, actually delivering a product will take a while, Altman said .",neutral,"apple, openai, iphone, devices, io"

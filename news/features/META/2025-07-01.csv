" Apple is considering using AI technology from Anthropic PBC or OpenAI to power a new version of Siri . The iPhone maker has talked with both companies about using their large language models for Siri . It has asked them to train versions of their models that could run on Apple’s cloud infrastructure for testing .  The company currently powers most of its AI features with homegrown technology that it calls Apple Foundation Models . A switch to Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI’s ChatGPT models for Siri would be an acknowledgment that the company is struggling to compete in generative AI .  The project to evaluate external models was started by Siri chief Mike Rockwell and software engineering head Craig Federighi . They were given oversight of Siri after the duties were removed from the command of John Giannandrea, the company’s AI chief .  Anthropic's technology is most promising for Siri’s needs, people said . The Siri assistant has fallen behind popular AI chatbots . Apple's attempts to upgrade the software have been stymied by engineering snags and delays .  Apple has already approved a multibillion dollar budget for 2026 for running its own models via the cloud but its plans for beyond that remain murky . Executives have grown increasingly open to the idea that embracing outside technology is the key to a near-term turnaround .  Apple considered acquiring Perplexity in order to bolster its AI work, Bloomberg has reported . The company is working on a series of projects, including a tabletop robot and glasses that will make heavy use of AI .  Meta Platforms Inc. and OpenAI are offering some of the AI industry’s most in-demand talent . Apple is known to pay its AI engineers half of what they can get on the open market .  The iPhone maker requested a custom version of Claude and ChatGPT that could run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers . Apple believes that running the models on its own chips housed in Apple-controlled cloud servers will better safeguard user privacy .  Apple is opening up the on-device models to third-party developers later this year . The company hasn't announced plans to give apps access to the cloud models . The cloud servers don’t have the capacity to handle a flood of new features .  Apple and Anthropic have disagreed over preliminary financial terms . The AI startup is seeking a multibillion-dollar annual fee that increases sharply each year . The struggle to reach a deal has left Apple contemplating working with OpenAI .  Apple killed the project — announced last year as Swift Assist — about a month ago . The company later this year is rolling out a new Xcode that can tap into third-party programming models . App developers can choose from ChatGPT or Claude .",neutral,"siri, ai, apple, iphone, chatbots"

" Meta has had a big court win on this front, with a federal judge ruling that Meta did not violate copyright law in training its AI models on original works . Back in 2023, a group of authors, including high-profile comedian Sarah Silverman, launched legal action against Meta and OpenAI over the use of their copyrighted works .  Authors claim Meta and OpenAI used their legally protected material without consent . Judge Vince Chhabria ruled that Meta’s use of these works is for “transformative” purpose .  The judge ruled that because the re-use of the works was not intended to create a competing market for these works, the application of “fair use” in this case applies . The judge notes that the case “presented no meaningful evidence on market dilution at all,” and that Meta’s defense that it can use these works under fair use is applicable .  Just judge: ""In cases involving uses like Meta’s, it seems like the plaintiffs will often win, at least where those cases have better-developed records on the market effects of the defendant’�s use.”  The judge ruled in favor of Anthropic in a similar case . The sticking point is the argument of ‘fair use’ in the context of re-use for alternative purpose . Last week, a federal judger ruled that Anthropic can continue training its AI models on copyright-protected content .  LLMs and AI projects fall into that category under the legal definition of copyright . The intent is not to re-create such work, but to facilitate new usage based on elements of it . An individual artist would be better placed to win a case where an AI work has clearly replicated theirs .  AI projects are able to use content that they can legally access under fair use provisions, as they’re not intended to facilitate replication, and harm their respective industries .

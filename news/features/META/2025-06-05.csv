" EssilorLuxottica is a colossus shaping the vision of billions around the world . Yet its veritable presence hides in plain sight, underscoring that there’s so much more to it than meets the eye .  EssilorLuxottica controls 25% of the eyewear market . It reported €26.5 billion in revenue last year and has a market capitalization of €112 billion . The company’s roots go back to 1849, when it was founded in Paris .  Luxottica was founded in 1961 by Leonardo Del Vecchio in Agordo, Italy, to make components for the optical industry . The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1990 (and in Milan in 2000)  Essilor and Luxottica had become the world’s largest suppliers of prescription lenses and eyewear, respectively . The two also had near-equal and vast market shares of 13% and 14% in the eyewearing space .  The Franco-Italian company operates in the complex convergence of eye care, fashion eyewear, and medical technology . It invests as much as €350 million in R&D annually and is chasing deals that will make its products even more critical to how people experience the world .  EssilorLuxottica secured its omnipresence in the world today by masterfully capturing every segment of the eyewear value chain . The self-made entrepreneur traced a stunning rags-to-riches story: He started working at age 14 as an apprentice to a metal engraver .  Luxottica learned to master vertical integration, not just for its own suite of products, but for the entire eyewear and eye care industry . Being vertically integrated fueled a virtuous cycle that made the company boom . “If I had to sum up how successful the business model is, really, 90% comes from vertical integration,"" says Cédric Rossi .  The mystery behind markups on eyeglasses has long chased the industry, with some speculating they can soar as high as 1,000% . Houlihan Lokey estimates gross margins on prescription eyewear are upwards of 65% .  Luxottica became virtually inescapable for customers seeking eyewear . The stores put the company at the intersection of demand and supply by connecting people to optometrists . Another example of how vertical integration helped the company was in rejiggering Ray-Ban’s appeal .  Ray-Ban is EssilorLuxottica’s crown jewel and the vessel for some of its breakthrough wearable innovations . The iconic sunglasses were sported by Audrey Hepburn inBreakfast at Tiffany’sand Tom Cruise in Top Gun .  At the center of EssilorLuxottica’s existence is its research focus, which has yielded over 15,000 patents . The company works with a network of researchers, engineers, and designers who help address vision impairments .  EssilorLuxottica sees myopia as one of the “biggest threats facing health care.” More than half the world’s population is projected to suffer from nearsightedness by 2050 . The company developed the Stellest lenses, which can slow myopia progression by 67% .  Demand for myopia management spectacles and contact lenses has risen at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31% and 13% in the past five years . EssilorLuxottica’s OneSight Foundation has undertaken to eradicate uncorrected poor visionby 2050 .  In late 2024, EssilorLuxottica confirmed a long-term agreement with Metato create “multigenerational smart eyewear” Other tech companies, including Google, have tried to crack the wearable eye tech market .  Merging Essilor and Luxottica had been “a lifelong dream” for founder Del Vecchio . Dealmaking savvy has been the greatest enabler of both companies' individual histories .  EssilorLuxottica bought Nuance Hearing in 2023 to fight the stigma surrounding hearing aids and embed audio enhancement tools into eyeglasses . In the past six months, the Paris-headquartered giant has bought ophthalmology group Optegra, AI audio startup Pulse Audition, noninvasive medical device company Espansione Group, and retinal imaging startup Cellview .  In 2019, EssilorLuxottica announced a bid for GrandVision, which owned a network of over 7,000 stores globally . Regulators green-lit the €7 billion deal in 2021 on the condition that the eyewear giant sell its own brand .  EssilorLuxottica floated the idea of acquisitions to grow its production capabilities in the U.S. if tariffs were to kick in . CEO Millerisaid he won’t rush a decision . For now, the company will increase prices in the American market to offset the levies .  EssilorLuxottica has reported five years of sales growth, barring 2020, when the pandemic hit . The company’s shares have risen about 20% in the past year . Del Vecchio died in 2022 at the age of 87, following the family behind the hazelnut-flavored chocolates Ferrero Rocher .  EssilorLuxottica won’t have a straightforward path ahead . It will have to contend with the likes of Warby Parker, which went public in 2021 . It’s diversified enough to be up to the challenges of the future .  Kering Eyewear, a division within the broader luxury conglomerate,partnered withGoogle in late May to make AI-powered glasses . In a 2024 report, the company acknowledged that the need for optical products will continue to grow .  U.S. consumers are consumers worldwide, according to CNN.com . The company is focused on its focus on women and minorities in the United States and Canada .",neutral,"luxottica, essilorluxottica, essilor, eyewear, eyewearing"

" Alphabet and Meta Platforms are the leaders in their tech arenas and have attractive prospects . Both companies have the qualities of forever investments .

" Apple (AAPL) faced Epic Games in a landmark court case in 2021 . Apple was ordered to let developers inform users about payment methods outside its app store . Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers dramatically escalated the ongoing legal battle between Apple and Epic Games .  Judge Rogers ruled Apple's response to the injunction as deliberately anticompetitive . Apple had secretly imposed a 27% fee on transactions conducted through external links, barely lower than their usual commission . Rogers referred both Apple and Alex Roman to federal prosecutors for potential criminal contempt charges .  Apple filed an emergency appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court, arguing that compliance with the injunction would cause significant financial harm . Apple claimed that allowing unrestricted external payment methods could cost the company billions in annual revenue, severely undermining its App Store business model . Judge Rogers refused to delay enforcing her order, emphasizing Apple’s repeated delays and clear non-compliance . Legal analysts predict that Apple faces significant hurdles in its appeal due to the abundance of evidence presented against it .  Epic Games submitted Fortnite for review, aiming to resume availability on iPhones and iPads . Apple's compliance remains uncertain, as the injunction does not explicitly force Apple to restore Epic’s developer account or immediately approve the fan-favorite game . The outcome of this conflict extends far beyond Apple and Epic Games .  The ruling aligns with new regulations such as the European Digital Markets Act . The U.S. Department of Justice has its own antitrust case against Apple . The ruling energized a coalition of developers and companies, including Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Match (MTCH)  On Wall Street, Apple carries a Moderate Buy rating with 17 Buys, eight Holds, and four Sells over the past three months . Despite the ongoing legal squabble, Apple stock remains resilient .  The potential financial repercussions for Apple are substantial, with billions of dollars in annual revenue potentially at risk . The mandated adjustments to Apple’s App Store policies could compel the company to reevaluate core elements of its longstanding business strategy .",negative,"apple, appeal, court, injunction, antitrust"
" The Justice Department’s principal antitrust division deputy, Roger Alford, said the new administration is going to aggressively pursue illegal competition . The approach is already evident in a number of antitrust enforcement cases targeting Big Tech companies .  The FTC is also asking for D.C. federal district court judge James Boasbergin a separate antitrust trial to force Meta to sell off Instagram as well as WhatsApp . Many of these cases started during the first Trump administration, where Alford also worked .  The DOJ is also working to prevent harmful monopoly conduct before it happens, Alford said . One way is by adopting more flexible merger review standards . Consent decrees with merging parties that put antitrust concerns at bay, he said .  There’s a need to update “a whole variety” of ambiguous antitrust laws, he said . The administration's philosophy is that it can best promote US competition and innovation by focusing on unfair competition in industries that the public cares about .

" Meta Platforms' growth rate has been slowing in recent quarters . A recession and trade war with China could further impact its growth rate . Amid a slowdown, there could be more attention on Reality Labs and its mounting losses .  Meta is already noticing a slowdown in ad spend from Chinese online retailers as a result of the U.S.' tough trade policy . If that trend continues, the company's growth rate may decline even further this year .  If companies are worried about a downturn, one of the first places they could look to trim budgets is in advertising and marketing . Yet another risk is the antitrust trial Meta faces this year, which may result in it having to sell Instagram and/or WhatsApp .  Reality Labs incurred a whopping $4.2 billion loss in just the first three months of 2025 . The rest of Meta's business has been performing well, allowing the company to turn an operating profit of $17.6 billion this past quarter . Currently, the social media stock trades at 23 times its trailing earnings and may look cheap .  Meta Platforms stock has fallen by 12% in the past three months after reaching highs of more than $700 . The stock is dependent on the strength of the ad market, and while it has benefited from a strong economy and advertisers flocking to its platform, the tide could turn . An antitrust trial involving the company could lead to it having to sell WhatsApp and Instagram .  The Motley Fool’s total average return is 948% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to170% for the S&P 500 . If you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $796,353!",negative,"stock, market, antitrust, meta, profit"

" Meta Platforms' losses on its Reality Labs division have continually risen over the years . The company has invested aggressively into the metaverse without any clear payoff .

Facebook generated an operating profit of nearly $21.8 billion, which easily covered the losses from Reality Labs . Investors may become more demanding of a payoff from that investment sooner rather than later . The second reason is that it highlights a deeper issue: poor asset allocation .

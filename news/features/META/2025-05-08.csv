" In the UK, 7pc of people report often feeling lonely - up from 5pc a decade ago . The figure climbs to 10pc among 16 to 24-year-olds who are now spending up to six hours a day online . The ubiquity of social media has been blamed for exacerbating feelings of isolation .  Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg wants people to find comfort in machines . He said the average American has fewer than three friends and wants more connectivity . Millions of teenagers are already using MyAI, a chatbot from MyAI .  Zuckerberg has suggested chatbots like these could be useful for ‘talking through difficult conversations’ But not everyone believes more technology is really the answer to the loneliness epidemic .  Tech giants have made them ‘too agreeable’ with none of the ‘friction and awkwardness” of real conversations, Zuckerberg says . “There is a real concern that, as a result, these systems may make it harder for people to make and keep friends, by leading people to cultivate unrealistic expectations of human relationships”  Just 12pc of people felt an AI chatbot would give good relationship or mental health advice . Only 22pc felt it would be a good conversation partner . There is some evidence to suggest AI can help people’s mental health .  Meta said the chats were “manufactured’, but that it had tightened its safeguards . Andy Burrows, of the Molly Rose Foundation, says Zuckerberg’s ‘vision’ is “disturbingly creepy” and “raises profound questions over whether it is appropriate for Mark Zuckerberg to be making these kinds of societal judgments”  AI chatbots can be remarkably unsupportive in times of crisis, experts say . Users who engage in personal conversations with chatbots tend to experience higher loneliness . Experts say chatbots are unlikely to lead to lower feelings of loneliness .  “At some level an AI chatbot will always be unsatisfying and will not meet that need,” he says . Humans are social animals who rely on personal interactions to feel safe and fulfilled . “It is not a genuine form of social connection.”",positive,"chatbots, chatbot, chats, conversations, conversation"
" Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other most popular stocks on Robinhood in 2025 . Individual investors, often called retail investors, on platforms as Robinhood represent an increasingly influential market segment . Notable examples include the 2021 short squeezes in stocks that caused billions of losses to several hedge funds .  Retail investors have injected billions of dollars into US stocks during the recent stock market correction . Small-cap technology was one of the favorite sector picks of individual investors amid the meltdown .  The big question is how one could exploit the signals communicated by the retail trading activity on platforms such as Robinhood? The answer is by investing in the same stocks that are bought by both retail and institutional investors . Buying pressure from both these market segments will inevitably lead to upward momentum .  US employers added 177,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2 percent . Lower odds of recession means higher likelihood of stronger earnings and thus higher stock prices . The Magnificent 7 is well-positioned to continue pushing the overall market higher .  The Magnificent 7 is such a large segment of the market that their strength could more than offset any weakness in industrial activity and the consumer discretionary sector, which have been sluggish year-to-date . The demand for cloud computing will inevitably rise, stimulating their earnings .  Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a technology company that owns leading platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Meta Quest VR .

" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke at Stripe's annual Sessions conference in San Francisco . Zuckerberg said he wants to create a black-box, end-to-end AI ad tool .

Zuckerberg first described this hypothetical machine on a Stratechery podcast last week . He says it could have implications for the ad industry . Zuckerberg: ""We're gonna be able to come up with, like, 4,000 AI systems that gets built""  Meta has experimented with AI-generated imagesandcommentsin feeds, as well as AI chatbots users can interact with .

In Q1, Meta absolutely smashed expectations out of the park,collecting an incredible revenue of $42.3 billion . That number was an impressive 16% increase from last year’s quarter . I believe the stock has a clear path to surpassing the $800 mark within the next 12 months .  Meta isn’t merely making a profit; it’s generating cash at an astonishing rate . In Q1 alone, operating cash flow amounted to a substantial $24 billion . Even after making considerable investments, its free cash flow reached an impressive $10.3 billion .

CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed to these improvements, mentioning that they directly impacted user engagement, 7% higher on Facebook and 6% on Instagram compared to last year .  Following a dramatic run-up in the share price, some investors may be asking themselves whether Meta shares are now overvalued . I believe that Meta remains reasonably valued, if not undervalued, given its long-term moat from AI . Its trailing price-to-earnings ratio is comfortably in the low 20s .  On Wall Street, Meta has a consensus Strong Buy rating based on 40 Buys, two Holds, and one Sell rating over the past three months . Theaverage META price target is $698.63, indicating a 17% upside potential over the next 12 months . Meta has repeatedly proven capable of delivering robust performance, despite market turbulence .  I think Meta’s current valuation remains attractive based on its growth potential, quality of cash flows, and strategic industry position . As user engagement continues to climb, ad revenue grows robustly, and cost containment is efficient, Meta remains poised to richly reward shareholders .",positive,"meta, revenue, overvalued, market, investors"

" By one projection, artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a $15.7 trillion boost to the worldwide economy by 2030 . Nvidia has been the AI revolution's most-direct beneficiary . Five dominant companies with foundational operating segments have the tools and intangibles to surpass Nvidia's market cap by 2028 .  Nvidia's valuation climbed from $360 billion to end 2022 to well north of $3 trillion in less than two years . Nvidia's Hopper (H100) graphics processing unit (GPU) and next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture have been the preferred chips .  If an AI bubble were to form and burst, it would undoubtedly hit Nvidia stock hard . Competition is mounting in the AI-GPU space -- albeit from an unlikely source . I'd expect these headwinds to weigh down Nvidia stock over the coming three years .  Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounted for a third of all cloud infrastructure service spend during the fourth quarter of 2024 . More importantly, it's growing by a high-teens percentage on a year-over-year basis . Amazon's other high-growth ancillary segments include advertising services .  Amazon has the tools to generate outsized cash flow growth over the next three-to-five years . Google Cloud is incorporating artificial intelligence to give its clients access to generative AI solutions and large language model tools .  Meta Platforms is an ad-driven business -- even more so than Alphabet . No other social media company is particularly close to attracting the 3.43 billion daily active people that Meta averaged in March 2025 .  Payment facilitator Visa has the necessary catalysts to leapfrog Nvidia, when combined with the latter's headwinds . Visa's sustained double-digit sales and earnings growth rate is a function of its being the dominant player in payment processing domestically . The company is also sitting on an enviable treasure chest of capital .  Visa has the capital and cash flow to organically or acquisitively enter faster-growing (and chronically underbanked) emerging markets . If Berkshire Hathaway stuck to this trajectory, it could become a $2 trillion company by the midpoint of 2028 .  Warren Buffett loves putting Berkshire's cash to work in companies with robust capital-return programs . Berkshire Hathaway should have no trouble collecting in excess of $5 billion in dividend income over the next year . Relying on dividend stocks suggests Berkshire's investment portfolio is going to outperform over the long run .  Now is the best time to buy before it’s too late, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon .

" A jury in California ruled that NSO owed Meta $444,719 in compensatory damages - and $167.3 million in punitive damages . NSO said it would ""carefully examine the verdict's details and pursue appropriate legal remedies""  NSO has long argued that its software is used to track terrorists and pedophiles . But the firm has been implicated in abusive surveillance in countries around the world, including Saudi Arabia, Spain, Mexico, Poland and El Salvador .  The court heard about NSO's 140 person-strong research team, whose $50 million budget was in part devoted to exploiting security vulnerabilities in smartphones . Much about the spyware company's targets and clients remains unknown, in part because the firm refused to hand over evidence .  The Guardian newspaper reported last year that Israeli officials seized documents from NSO in an effort to prevent the files from making their way to U.S. court .

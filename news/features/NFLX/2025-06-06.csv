" Netflix is one of the few technology stocks that didn't experience a sell-off during the initial tariff announcements in April . Netflix trades at a premium to other companies in streaming and entertainment, but management's long-term vision might justify that . Several catalysts could push its shares even higher in the second half of 2025 .  In theory, tariffs can lead to higher prices (inflation) for consumers, causing them to cut back on discretionary spending . However, Netflix offers viewers a number of subscription tiers based on price . In other words, it's unlikely that rising tariffs will lead to a wave of subscriber churn for Netflix .  Netflix stock is trading at an all-time high of roughly $1,222 per share . Over the last 10 years, Netflix has completely transformed its business from a platform featuring licensed content to one that's producing billions of dollars of original content .  Despite the premium valuation, I still see Netflix as a rock-solid buy, given its edge over the competition . Buying the stock at current prices will require patience, though . Its trajectory in the remainder of 2025 may be quite bullish, but even bigger gains are in store for long-term investors .  The Motley Fool’s total average return is994% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to172% for the S&P 500 .

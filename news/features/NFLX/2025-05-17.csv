Preorders are off to a strong start following the debut of the first official gameplay trailer at PAX East last week . This includes Mafia, the Old Country which 2K and Hangar 13 will introduce on August 8, this linear narrative-driven game is a premium experience in the vein of early Mafia titles set against the stunning, authentic background of 1900 Sicily .  Looking ahead, we currently expect to deliver 25 titles throughout fiscal 2027 and 2028, including 17 immersive core releases, including Grand Theft Auto VI and five sports simulation games, four mobile games and four new iterations of previously released titles .  We delivered an outstanding finish to fiscal 2025 with broad-based strength across our company . Throughout the year, we positioned our business for sustainable long-term growth .

For our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. this will be an exciting period for our many stakeholders, from our colleagues, to our players, industry partners and shareholders.  Strauss Zelnick: We've always had variable pricing. We aim to make the best entertainment on earth and bring that to all consumers wherever they are . And I think our view is that if you create a huge hit and everyone wants it and everyone buys it, the revenue will take care of itself .  The impairment was from, but it was a partial impairment of one of our units and it's a result of updating long-term expectations, and that's something that we acquired to test annually or whenever the indicators of the environment arise . Doug Creutz, TD Cowen. Sorry about that, I fat fingered my first attempt .  There's no reason why we wouldn't be able to reach those margins again? Lainie Goldstein . We've been doing a lot of structural things within the business to offset those costs . You'll see that in our expenses being reduced this year and seeing those margins coming down .  The mobile gaming segment is a challenging one broadly, creating new mobile hits is incredibly difficult . Zynga is the only company in the space that is regularly creating new native mobile hits, most recently with Match Factory! and Color Block Jam .  Strauss Zelnick: ""The further away we are from the results, the harder it is to predict because things can change. However, in terms of our -- both our hopes and our expectations, we're more optimistic than we were before""  Strauss Zelnick: ""We just, in the normal course, would not typically guide to those numbers this far in advance. We have said that we expect sequential growth for both fiscal '26 and '27. And the guidance we just gave, of course, still reflects meaningful year-over-year top line growth and reflects a new record for net bookings""  In aggregate, GTA Online and Red Dead Online were down a bit in the full fiscal year . The trailer did set a record for views in its first 24 hours, 475 million . Rockstar Games broke the Internet .  We're launching four titles with Nintendo Switch 2, and that's, I think, a bigger array of releases than we've ever offered before with the new Nintendo platform . Historically being a third party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging, but we're stepping up too because we have great optimism for the platform .  Strauss Zelnick: Color Block Jam was really a reflection of an evolution of strategy at Rollic . All of our studios work together, that's the whole point of being one company . They do coordinate the share best practices than Zynga itself .  NBA 2K's goal is to be the most creative, the most innovative company in the entertainment industry . We can promote inside our ecosystem on a much more efficient basis than someone could outside of an ecosystem like ours . We think that gives us an enormous competitive advantage .  Another really strong quarter for that franchise, it's second in a row . Karl Slatoff: ""I don't think there's anything specific that's been done in this quarter that would call out the performance of the NBA,"" he said .  Strauss Zelnick: The focus is always on engagement, and that's where the growth has really been is that year-over-year this game has -- engagement has gone up. which is very tough to do when you're on a 12-month cycle . And I said specifically in the quarter, MyTEAM is having a fantastic quarter, so that helps a lot as well .  Mobile has become a significant and indeed material part of our business . I've been saying for years that I expected the cost of third-party distribution to decline . I do think the recent court rulings reflect movement in that direction, it is early, but these are all positive signs for us .  Karl Slatoff: Our partnership with Netflix has been fantastic. We've only done a few titles at this point. We think that there's an opportunity, again, on a game-by-game basis for us to continue to bring titles to the Netflix. I'm not announcing anything at this time, but we do believe that they're a terrific partner. We are doing a BioShock movie with Netflix .  Mobile marketing expense will continue to be elevated . Lainie Goldstein: We expect operating expense growth of approximately 3% year-over-year . But we do expect to deliver operating expense leverage as net bookings growth of 6% is planned to outpace our operating expense expansion .  Lainie Goldstein: It's not a more narrow range than usual. I mean usually, for the full year, we gave a specific type of range on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but it's not different than it usually is .  Strauss Zelnick: Why do I think GTA VI is so widely anticipated? We all do. Grand Theft Auto V is in the standard bar, not just for our company but for the industry since it was launched, it's not only survived through three console generations, it survived .  Everyone anticipates the next generation of Grand Theft Auto, but there's nothing in between . The film is still fresh, it's still in market, so everyone anticipates next James Bond movie . But look, we're not in the business of claiming success until it happens .  Strauss Zelnick: Our guide is for the next 10 months essentially. That's the part of the fiscal year that hasn't elapsed yet . It's very difficult to predict where tariffs will land given how things have bumped around so far . We want to deliver more value to a consumer than whatever that consumer pays .  We feel reasonably confident that our guide wouldn't be meaningfully affected in less tariffs ran off in a very different direction than we currently expect . The $2 billion of development cost really is supporting our extremely robust release schedule that we talked about for the next few years .  Lainie Goldstein: Internal royalties, the breakdown is driven by the product mix . Martin Yang: I'm in a pretty noisy background. Can you talk about the internal royalties in the COGS breakdown?  This is a great time for our company and a really exciting and challenging time in our industry and in the entertainment industry broadly . Arrogance is the enemy of continued success. We aim to deliver and over deliver. We think that the release schedule that we have coming to market is second to none .  You may now disconnect from the conversation on this morning's call . The call off line will be recorded as part of our live webcast . We are happy to return to the page you came from .",neutral,"earnings, upcoming, grand, zelnick, profitability"

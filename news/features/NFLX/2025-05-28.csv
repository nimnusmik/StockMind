" This company plans to follow the same playbook that got it to $500 billion to reach $1 trillion . The$1 trillion club has invited quite a few new members through its doors since Apple broke through its threshold in 2018 . But predicting the next member of the club isn't easy .  Netflix already boasts a $500 billion valuation as of this writing . It's not tied down by declining legacy operations like linear TV networks . Netflix has taken a systematic approach to growing its business . It plans content expenses well in advance of when they hit its income statement .  Netflix has increased its operating margin from 13% in 2019 to 26.7% in 2024 . Management thinks it can double its revenue between 2024 and 2030 . That implies an operating margin of about 40% by 2030, an expansion of 11 percentage points .  Netflix has made a big shift in its strategy over the last few years by introducing an ad-supported tier to its offerings . Management thinks advertising revenue can double in 2025 and grow to a $9 billion business by 2030 .  Ad sales are much more cyclical, so an economic slowdown will negatively impact the new business . Netflix expects the ad-supported tiers to remain the biggest source of revenue and growth for a long time . Advertising can provide an additional boost in revenue for each extra minute Netflix viewers spend .  Netflix's goals seem reasonable, even if it won't be as easy for management to grow like it has in the past . Successfully tripling operating income means Netflix will need a valuation of about 32 times its operating income in 2030 . That's well below its historic average, so it's not out of the realm of possibility .  The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years . Consider when Netflixmade this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $639,271! The Motley Fool’s total average return is 957% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to167% for the S&P 500 .",neutral,"netflixmade, netflix, revenue, trillion, market"
" Netflix introduced America to the concept of streaming video on demand in 2007 . It required members to subscribe to its traditional DVD-by-mail service to participate . Here’s a look at where your net worth might be today if you had used the money spent on your Netflix subscription to invest in Netflix stock .  In 2008, Netflix launched unlimited streaming of its 90,000-title library for $9 per month . In 2011, Netflix lowered the price of its standard package to $8, but it made up for it by jacking up the cost of its DVDs .  On Oct. 25, 2011, Netflix suffered its biggest single-day drop when shares fell 34.9% after the company reported a net loss of 800,000 subscribers . The result was nearly universal customer outrage and the 2011 stock price crash .  At the start of 2022, Netflix added $1.50 to its standard subscription price where it remained until the beginning of this year . With the pandemic making streaming more of a necessity than an amenity, Netflix sees room for another increase . The data used will stop after the full year for the sake of this example .  Today, Netflix is trading at around $1,194 according to MarketWatch . You’d have a whopping $642,372 if you had invested in Netflix instead of watching it .",neutral,"netflix, streaming, subscription, unlimited, cost"

Netflix's advertising business represents perhaps the most compelling growth catalyst for the company's future .

" Motley Fool analyst Tim Beyers and host Ricky Mulvey discuss Walmart's response to tariff uncertainty . How YouTube is capitalizing on points of ""maximum attention"" Karl Thiel joins host Mary Long to dive into the executive order on prescription drug prices and questions for pharmaceutical companies .  Stock Advisor’s total average return is 957% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to167% for the S&P 500 . If you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $804,688! The Motley Fool Money podcast was recorded on May 15, 2025 .  Tim Beyers: The big story here, Tim, is tariffs . Chief Financial Officer, John David Rainey, went on CNBC and said, ""We're wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb"" He says, if Walmart is under pressure to raise prices, it's going to have broader effects on the economy .  Walmart's e-commerce business rose 22% on the year and it was the first quarter of profitability . Ricky Mulvey: Even for a giant, it's really hard to make a profit, even for Walmart, which is pretty darn efficient .  The last few quarters have seen tailwinds for this company, including in the e-commerce channel . But we think of them as everyday low prices and everything . It's less clear whether this company can keep its brand advantage .  CFO Rainey: Walmart is not the kind of company that sells something so unique that it can make margin on uniqueness of what flows through distribution channel . Mulvey: Millions of people would feel an immense amount of pain if Walmart were to suddenly go away. But right now, it's also trading at a historically high valuation .  Walmart trades for 1.2 times revenue and a 1.4% free cash flow yield . Tim Beyers: If you're holding a defensive, maybe a cyclical stock like this, should you be sweating this a little bit?  Walmart is not the kind of business that I would be inclined to sell, but I might be just more careful with it, Ricky Mulvey says . Mulvey: Buyers might be prepared to hold for a decade or longer, collect your dividends as cash and then reinvest .  The ad supported tier has 94 million monthly active users . That's grown by more than 20 million people since November . The ad tier of Netflix reaches more 18-34 year-olds than any US broadcast or cable network .  Beyers: ""I think its success reflects something important that Netflix has quite a lot of family friendly, kid-friendly, popcorn worthy programming that pulls in younger adults"" Mulvey: ""There's just room to penetrate really across the age spectrum""  Netflix is unveiling how they're thinking about ads into the future . The basic promise is that we have this fabulous algorithm that can recommend shows to people based on their viewing habits . The part that sounds a little scarier to me is this offer of shoppable mid roles in AI-driven dynamic product placement inside hit shows like Squid Game .  More important than the AI tools, I think, is the vastness and variety of the content library . I doubt that the AI is going to immediately have margin impact . I think scale is what matters for Netflix here . If this continues, scale means there will be big winners and big losers .  Tim Beyers: The expansion of the advertising tier, especially worldwide, is the most important thing . Ricky Mulvey: For advertisers, consider Squid Game as a show that is about how money makes people do awful and terrible things, it all scales up the wealth ladder .  Ricky Mulvey: Operating margin expansion has been on the menu for Netflix for a while now . I would be watching for it coinciding with revenue growth in overseas territories . If we get expanding operating margin plus big growth in non-US non-Canadian territories, I think we're really onto something here, because those two together signal pricing power in emerging markets, which is really hard to get .  The Motley Fool Live blog is a great place to get analyst insights in what's going on in the market . YouTube believes there is value to advertisers in placing ads at points of maximum attention . Tim Beyers: It might be a little bit annoying, but I'm just going to say here, this is payback time .  Ricky Mulvey: Will it be the kind of thing that will drive up ad prices? That's a maybe . There is a logic to it, but more importantly, this is the thing that allows YouTube to price ad space at a premium, which they do need to do .  Tim Beyers: How meaningful is this for Alphabet as a whole, as a two-trillion-dollar company? He says it could be the thing that disconnects YouTube from a reliance on search . If YouTube figures this out and gets better at selling premium advertising disconnected from the parent ad business, it adds a creative value .  The Fundrises Flagship Fund, a 1.1 billion dollar real estate portfolio, has more than 4,000 single family homes in the Sunbelt communities . The flagship fund taps into some of real estate's most attractive qualities, long term appreciation potential, and a hedge against inflation .  A prescription for a weight loss drug will cost you about $1,000 per month more in the US than it will in Europe . President Trump rolled out an executive order that attempts to bring that price down to the lowest level across developed countries . Up next, up next, Motley Fool senior analyst Karl Thiel joins our colleague Mary Long to break down the prescription drug pricing executive order .  Trump said in a press conference that the US is subsidizing other countries' drug prices . Even though the US represents the largest pharma market in the world, there are essentially three pharma markets . There's the US, there's Europe, and there's Asia .  The US is essentially the profit center for global drug sales . Europe is twice the size and only 23% of sales, Asia is only 21% . Drugs here cost somewhere on the order of two to four times what they do in Europe . In China, prices can run something like 10 times .  Karl Thiel: How do these lesser known characters, the PBMs, actually fit into this picture of drug pricing? Thiel: This is unique to the United States that you have this extra layer called pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs . Thiel: A lot of drug executives have been pointing the fingers at PBMs as the middlemen who are really responsible for high prices .  If drug companies had to make the best of a bad situation, they would likely just preserve their high list prices and just offer bigger rebates . Pharmacy benefit managers would have profited off of that . Part of the idea is that you need to take a bite .  Karl Thiel: How can an executive order from an American president mandate the pricing power of individual companies, especially those that are headquartered and based overseas, not on American soil . Thiel: A lot of what people are talking about when they talk about this proposal right now is not what just got announced because that's fairly short on details . But what's different this time around is that it's actually much broader .  In order to actually make a system that work, you'd have to pass new laws . That means you need cooperation of Congress and the cooperation of the courts . To do that, there is no enforcement mechanism, which is why it's basically right now just a request that companies lower prices .  Pharmaceutical companies will lose some of the profits that they've come to expect, says Karl Thiel . Thiel: ""If it moves forward the way as envisioned, then certainly companies would see their profits go down"" Thiel: There's no real mechanism to make prices go up in Europe .  Trump's promise to get rid of the middlemen in drug pricing is not likely to be affected by changes in this industry moving forward . Mary Long: There are other healthcare companies that I can see potentially being affected by these changes .  A big part of the reason that there's this focus on PBMs is because of the way the industry has evolved . What happens is that companies set a list price, and then they negotiate rebates with PBMs . The bigger the rebate, the bigger the profit for the PBM is. They take a part of that rebate for themselves .  Karl Thiel: ""Everybody took the 5% discounted one because that one came with huge rebates. That's the somewhat counterintuitive, I will say, incentives in this industry"" Ricky Mulvey: ""That's not the whole picture, but that is part of it."" Mary Long: Karl Thiel, thank you so much for the insight and for helping to demystify this industry .

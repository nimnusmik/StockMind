" Three brand-name, non-tech stocks have completed forward splits in 2025 . The logical candidate to split its stock next is a cash cow with a sustainable moat whose shares are, once again, within a stone's throw of an all-time high .  Splits can move a company's share price up or down, but there's a sizable variance in how these two types of splits are perceived by the investing community . Reverse splits are often enacted by struggling companies that are attempting to avoid being delisted from a major stock exchange .  The ""Class of 2025"" stock-split stocks all come from outside the tech sector . Wholesale industrial and construction supplies company Fastenal was the first to cross the proverbial finish line by completing a 2-for-1 forward split after the close of trading on May 21 .  The third premier non-tech stock-split stock this year is automated electronic brokerage firmInteractive Brokers Group . O'Reilly's hub-and-spoke distribution model ensures that more than 153,000 stock keeping units (SKUs) can reach drivers and mechanics the same day or on an overnight basis .  Since 1980, companies have gained an average of 25.4% in the 12 months following their initial forward split announcement . In comparison, the S&P 500 has averaged an 11.9% increase over these same 12-month periods . Some companies with a high share price have demonstrated no interest in conducting a split .  Costco's membership-based model that keeps customers loyal to the brand is likely to see its share price extend well past $1,000 . Less than 20% of Netflix's shares are owned by non-institutional investors .  Social media giant Meta Platforms has never announced a stock split . Unlike Netflix, more than 27% of Meta's shares are held by everyday investors . In March, Meta had an average of 3.43 billion people visiting its family of apps daily . A forward split would also be a logical choice .  Mark Zuckerberg's company is sitting on a mountain of cash . It closed out the first quarter with more than $70 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities . Being a cash cow affords Meta the opportunity to aggressively invest in its AI-driven future . Best of all, Meta Platforms' stock remains reasonably inexpensive .  The case for Meta Platforms to become the highlight stock-split stock of 2025 grows stronger with each passing day . Consider when Netflixmade this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $664,089! The Motley Fool's total average return is994% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to172% for the S&P 500 .

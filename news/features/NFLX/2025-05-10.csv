" Netflix currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.61, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms . Of the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 30 are Strong Buy and two are Buy .  According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation . As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias .  The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations . The Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions . It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5 .  Near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research . Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which analysts provide current-year earnings estimates . In contrast, ABR is driven by earnings estimates, which are constantly revised .  The recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Netflix . optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term .",neutral,"analysts, stocks, investors, stock, netflix"

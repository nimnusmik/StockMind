F1 movie team had its own F1 race cars, fictional team personnel, and even pit setups to replicate the 11th team on the real F1 grid . Apple created special cameras embedded in the race cars to capture all the action .  Williams counts US brands like Duracell batteries, Michelob Ultra beer and Kraken among others as sponsors . Title sponsorships, like Williams’ Atlassian deal, can for the most lucrative title sponsorship deals .  Williams has had mixed results this year, sitting fifth in the team standings .

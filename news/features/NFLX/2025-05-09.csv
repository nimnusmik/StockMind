" Magnite's first quarter 2025 earnings conference call will be conducted by Nick Kormeluk in investor relations . Please note this event is being recorded . As a reminder, this conference call is being broadcasted .  Michael Barrett, CEO; and David Day, our CFO. being recorded . We have posted financial highlight slides on our investor relations website to accompany today's presentation .  Our commentary today will include non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income per share . A discussion of these risks uncertainties and assumptions is set forth in the company's periodic reports filed with the SEC .  Q1 came in very strong and we exceeded total top line guidance with CTV growing 15% and DV+ growing 9%. We saw a nice bounce back in DV+ after Q4, showing how quickly ad spend can restart on our platform after a market slowdown .  Netflix continues to roll out their programmatic business globally, most recently in EMEA, with further expansion coming through the rest of the year . Magnite continues to be a critical part of Netflix's programmatic ad stack .  As more budgets flow into CTV, marketers are asking for more control, better transparency, in the shortest possible path to inventory . By collapsing the ad server and SSP into one platform, we remove an entire step in the process .  Magnite is an integrated purpose-built stack designed for the way CTV actually works . Buyers like Group M, Omnicom, and the Traisk have publicly voiced their support . Disney, Roku, Paramount, LG, Samsung, and Warner Brothers, Discovery, have also voiced support .  NCAA basketball continued to be an important live sports growth driver for T1 . We're excited about major upcoming events across MLB, the NBA and WNBA, NHL playoffs, as well as a wide range of college sports .  In uncertain times, marketers still want to advertise, particularly in a TV-like environment, but are uncomfortable committing ads then beyond the current quarter, which is the norm for linear TV . Programmatic CTV provides the maximum spend flexibility. The TV environment marketers crave. the upfront guarantee.  Magnite's SpringServe will be integrated into Saks to power omnichannel advertising across audio, video, and native display for Spotify subscribers worldwide . In early April, Spotify announced its new Spotify ad exchange, [Saks].  The court found that Google had engaged in illegal monopolistic practices with respect to its ad server and ad exchange, also known as an SSP . The court has scheduled the remedy phase for September 22 and has indicated that there will be attention to both behavioral and structural remedies .  We are looking forward to a more level playing field where all members of the ad tech industry have an equal chance to compete on their own merits . We estimate Google's exchange currently controls greater than 60% share in the DV+ market . We believe that we are exceptionally well positioned to capture any shift in market share that occurs as a result of Google ceasing its illegal practices .  We had a strong start to 2025, exceeding our Q1 contribution ex-TAC guidance for both CTV with growth of 15% and DB+ which grew 9%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 47% over the first quarter of last year, with a margin of 25%, significantly above expectations .  Total revenue was $156 million up 4% from Q1 2024 . Contribution ex-TAC was $146 million up 12% year-over-year . Technology, financial and business services were the strongest performing categories for all formats .  The first quarter was $109 million better than we expected, and up slightly from $106 million in the same period last year . The majority of the favorability to our guidance was driven by lower cloud computing costs and employee related expenses .  Just Ida grew 47% year-over-year to $37 million reflecting a margin of 25% . This was a result of both higher revenue and robust cost management efforts . Our cash balance at the end of Q1 was $430 million, a decrease from $483 million in Q1 . The decrease was due to typical seasonality in our business and share repurchases .  Our net leverage was 0.6x at the end of Q1, up slightly from the fourth quarter due to the typical cash seasonality and share repurchases . We continue to lower our capital costs with the completion of our second successful term loan repricing during the first quarter .  Year-to-date, we've effectively reduced dilution by 2.9 million shares for $43 million or $14.94 per share . As of today, we have $88 million remaining in our authorized share repurchase program, which we will continue to deploy strategically .  We expect contribution ex-TAC to be in the range of $154 million to $160 million . We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of 29% for Q2 at the midpoints .  Good to see the nice bumps back in DV+. Wanted to start with two on the Google case . Do you think the opportunities for Magnite have to wait for the structural divestiture, or do you think there are opportunities during some of these behavioral changes that could be implemented earlier? Michael Barrett: We would stand to benefit instantly from that .  Every 100 basis points increase in market share for us would result in roughly $50 million in contribution ex-TAC . We estimate that Google has more than 60% in DB+ and we have something in the mid-single digits . We're very excited about the way this is moving, you could see remedies put in place as early as the beginning of 2026 .  If our market share goes from 6% to 7%, it's almost a 20% increase in revenue, and of course we'd expect that to be, potentially significant higher, and from a flow through perspective, what's interesting is that we're already looking at all the same ad requests that Google's looking at . So it's a very significant and positive impact to our margins and free cash flow .  Magnite is the leading CTV first focus programmatic company . We are now creating the fastest, cleanest, highest fidelity path to the best premium CTV inventory in the industry .  Michael or David, do you expect the share gains there when -- whenever they start to occur? I think you said early is since the next year. Do you expect that to be more gradual or more dynamic? And then, David, what did you mean by the proportional, point, if you guys have mid-single digits and Google has 60%?  If Google has 60% market share, that means that the rest of us have split up 40% of market share . But given, our leadership position in the space, the SPO deals, the agency marketplaces that we run and so forth, there's opportunity for us to, we believe, take even more than our current share of that non Google market share. That's all I'm trying to say. It's significant opportunities .  Just wondering, how are your customer and advertiser conversations going? Is there anything that suggests that things could change? I know obviously you're you guys are being prudent, with the outlook, but any, anything in the customer and advertising conversations worth sharing or any further color on the macro?  Would be, it's prudent to be cautious in this environment, but I can't really point to anything where we heard one buyer say, I'm stopping spending, there's the obvious, right. European auto, that is shipping cars back to Europe and not shipping them to the US. Why are you going to advertise, but that's being offset by domestic auto advertising American made. So it's tends to be right now a counterbalance between those that have paused and those that are continuing and strengthening.  Michael Barrett: I think if you really look at the arc of programmatic and CTV, it's so nascent that there really isn't anything bad about any type of flavor of a transaction in programmatic . And in fact, if we're sourcing the demand, there really aren't much of a change in terms of demand, Michael Barrett said .  Advertisers love that live environment, even in a downturn, sports is going to be just fine . Programmatic is becoming much and much bigger player in the monetization efforts . So long story short, more programmatic is good and we're a long way away from a programmatic type having a dramatic impact on our take rate .  Programmatic Guaranteed and PMP, I thought that was the same rate card . But when you do Decisions Programmatic, which is what I would think you would be doing in live sports, isn't that twice the rate card when we're talking about mix shift within CSTD, TTD? Michael Barrett said yes .  Laura Martin: One of my takeaways from Possible that I had never heard before is I talked to two CEOs who were bringing data. In one case, the guy that made the most compelling travel data, selling it to SSPs like you, meeting with people like you in order to disintermediate the DSP so they could take part of the fee .  Curation is where audience segments are assembled on the publisher/SSP side . DSPs said, hey, if you want to buy this travel decorated audience, frequent flyers or whatever the case might be, you come here and buy it, as opposed to shipping the data to the DSP, having it assembled there .  Michael Barrett: ""Little by little, I think the market is starting to realize that SSPs ... aren't commodities"" He says DSPs are worth the 20% take rate because all the value is created there is audience creation .  Netflix will be your largest CTV revenue client by the end of 2025, Michael Barrett said in the past . I believe we qualified by saying one of -- if not our largest client on a run rate exiting the year . And we stand by that firmly. think, we're trying to position ourselves as that unique SSP .  Michael Barrett: There's definitely been price decline in CTV as it relates to CPMs. And that I believe really is just a factor of supply. And yes, there's, and we've talked about this. It pretty much occurred Q3 last year and is played out in the subsequent quarters .  There's never been more inventory of CTV and that has definitely led to a recalibration of CPMs . It really doesn't play out as it relates to our business from a take rate pressure standpoint . In fact, you might argue in a world where there's more inventory, people are going to lean more into programmatic and they're going to reward you more handsomely for bringing demand to them because they need it, because they have a lot of supply .  Michael Barrett: We're elated where this is all head. If it's fair, it's level. We're very happy how it gets there. That's for others to determine. But we think that we will win our out share size of market share from Google .  Third party attempts to capture, signal and replace the cookie are here and they're here to stay . Safari browser is quite popular and it doesn't have cookies and so therefore you're going to need cookie list solutions out there .  CPM decline in. app and the growth of CTV, it was never a cookie world and with the logged in authenticated user in the CTV environment that really is helping the audience segment creation on the publisher side at the SSP level .  It seems like every day there's another announcement of a company getting into that business with Gen AI accretive, Gen AI targeting . But ultimately what they all need is access to supply. So we're the first door knock and we feel that we're extremely well positioned to take advantage of those advertiser dollars for our media owners .  Magnite's first gen AI product that we produced that's in market now is for curation. We participate in the economics and curation, generally speaking in two ways. There is a modest fee to most of our curators for the effort of us onboarding them and making their inventory discoverable. And then of course, we also participate in curation .  Omar Dessouky: We're super bullish on it and we love our capabilities. We just extended the curation capabilities to the CTV platform and so early innings. But I think this is just going to be a story, a drumbeat story for the quarters to come.  A. lot of the streamers were requiring technology that was kind of ad server ish and streaming ish . And so by combining the two of them, they get the best of both worlds . So that is 100% some of the learnings we've taken away from some of our partnerships .  Michael Barrett: There's definitely a real decline there, but again, it's been offset by other categories of growth . We have not seen any decline in any specific category that's related to any kind of tariff affected outcome .  Some airlines have pulled some of their guidance have talked about, potential softening and some domestic travel . It's out of, I think, prudence that we reflected that, those conversations into the guide .  Shweta Khajuria: How are you positioning ahead of macro uncertainty on things that you can do and control so that when demand is back, you are positioned for outside share gains . Michael Barrett: We're only one of three that are authorized to be able to do business with Amazon, DSP .  Michael Barrett: We still believe that Programmatic is going to grow in the years to come . We're not going to do is make silly moves to try to chase a mythical margin number . We'll obviously tighten the belts, we'll shave where we can, but you shouldn't expect from us .  Q2 is off to a good start and we look forward to the year ahead, especially with the momentum we have from our strengthening competitive position . We are participating in the Lake Street Virtual NDR tomorrow .

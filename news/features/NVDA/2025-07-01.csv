" Long calls are perfect for betting on an asset’s future upside price movement . Time is the better asset when it comes to buying options contracts . Calls are contracts that give the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy a specified asset at a specified price .  A long call is a leveraged bet on the stock moving up before your expiration date . Since option contracts are time-bound, a portion of their value is derived from the remaining days to expiration . That extra breathing room can make all the difference between a winning trade and a frustrating loss .  Long calls have positive delta. premium is expected to change for every $1 move in the price of the underlying asset . The same 0.20 delta option has a 20% chance of expiring in the money .  For the sake of comparison, I’ll choose three examples from the selection based on three delta values: 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80 . For reference, NVDA is trading at $157.75, which means this particular long call is over 33% out of the money . To break even, the net debit would have to increase by more than 36% for the trade to start becoming profitable .  The last trade has 0.80 delta, or an 80% chance of expiring in the money . In this example, you can buy a 130-strike call for $37.35 per share or $3,735 total . However, the premium increased from $465 to $1,580 - or 240% .

" China is home to half of the world's AI researchers, according to EvenNvidia CEO Jensen Huang . Investors should have exposure to some AI companies in their portfolios -- and that includes Chinese exposure . Here's how a South African stock may offer the best way to play Chinese AI .  The best way to expose oneself to Chinese AI may be South African holding company Naspers . It's still very early in the AI races, and in truth, it's hard to know who is going to win out .  Tencent is building its own large model, called Hunyuan, which could lead to vast new AI opportunities . Tencent stock doesn't trade on U.S. stock exchanges, but it does trade over the counter as an American depositary receipt . European-domiciled Prosus owns more than 23% of Tencent's stock .  Naspers trades at a huge discount to the value of not only its net assets but also its Tencent stake alone . Management attributed that growing discount to its large size relative to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange . In 2019, Naspers created Prosus, a new entity it listed on the larger Euronext Exchange in Amsterdam .  Before this year, Prosus' businesses were free cash flow negative, so the company was dependent on Tencent stock sales and Tencent's dividend for cash for funding . However, in fiscal 2025, which ended in March, the company's non-Tencent businesses turned cash flow positive for the first time . Prosus also has a new CEO in Fabricio Bloisi, who took over the job exactly one year ago .  If Prosus wanted to buy a company or repurchase its stock at a big discount, it would have to sell part of its Tencent stake . That probably played into the ""conglomerate discount,"" as investors may not have liked the capital allocation of selling a high-quality business in Tencent to buy more risky and unprofitable startups . If a Prosus/Naspers valuation rerating occurs, that could make Prosus and/or Naspers the most attractive way to play Tencent .

" One Wall Street analyst is forecasting a runup in Nvidia stock to $250 . However, this new Street-high price target overlooks a number of tangible headwinds . Wall Street and investors have been waiting for the next technological leap that could catapult corporate growth .  Nvidia's market cap has jumped from $360 billion to an all-time closing high of $3.76 trillion, as of June 25 . PwC: AI technology can increase global gross domestic product by a whopping 26% come 2030 .  Loop Capital lifted Loop Capital's price target for Nvidia from $175 per share to $250 . If Nvidia's share count stays static, we're talking about a $6.1 trillion market cap . Nvidia is already the undisputed leader in graphics processing units deployed in AI-accelerated data centers .  An uptick in data center spending from governments, midsize cloud providers, and startup companies can lead to the next wave of supercharged growth for Nvidia . The other factor working in Nvidia's favor is that it's been able to grow into its valuation over the last year . Given the company's torrid sales and profit growth, Nvidia is trading at a forward-year earnings multiple of only 27 .  Every game-changing technology and innovation needs ample time to mature, and we're not at that point yet . The fact that most businesses aren't generating a positive return on their AI investments, suggests that investors have grossly overestimated the early-innings adoption rate and utility of this technology . This bodes poorly for Nvidia stock over the short run .  Nvidia's biggest competitive edge has been the persistent scarcity of AI-GPUs . Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is ramping up chip-on-wafer-to-substrate capacity . Many of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are internally developing AI-accelerating chips .

" Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have surged in recent years as the AI boom picked up speed . Investors eagerly piled into these players with the hope that AI would become the next game-changing technology . Stanley Druckenmiller sold Nvidia as it continued to soar and expressed regret about the decision .  Last year, Duquesne Family office head sold all of his shares of AI chip leader Nvidia . Now, in the first quarter of this year, Druckenmiller has made another bold move concerning a market-beating AI stock that's soared 1,500% .  Long-term investing offers us plenty of time to score a very satisfactory win . In the first quarter of this year, the billionaire sold all of his shares ofPalantir Technologies .  Druckenmiller bought Palantir stock in the first quarter of last year, so he held on to it for about a year . Last year, the shares surged 340%, then continued to march higher, advancing more than 70% from the start of this year through today .  It's important to remember that Druckenmiller is a professional and has the time and resources to quickly enter and exit positions .

" By now, it's clear that artificial intelligence (AI) is the next major technology platform . Big tech companies are pouring tens of billions of dollars into data centers to run the computing power required for AI . Nvidia dominates market share of data center GPUs .  Nvidia has delivered monster returns for early investors, but plenty of investors are wondering if the company's stock is still a good buy . In 2012, Apple was the most valuable company in the world, riding high from the recent launch of the iPhone and the iPad . Investors seemed unable to envision the dramatic future growth of Apple's services business .  At the time, Apple was trading at a discount to theS&P 500, which was valued at a P/E of 15.9 . While Apple's market cap has risen about six times, or 500%, the growth in the stock price has been nearly 1,000% due to share buybacks .  Nvidia stock trades at a P/E of 45 and a forward P /E of just 31.5 . That compares to a 25.7 P/e ratio for the S&P 500 and a 20.5 forward . Nvidia might not become a ten-bagger like Apple was in 2012, but just like investors were underestimating the growth of mobile technology .

During the first quarter, more than half of Appaloosa's fund's shares of artificial intelligence (AI) darlingNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) were sold . Tepper disposed of 380,001 shares of Nvidia in first quarter -- 56% sequential quarterly reduction .  Competition is picking up in a big way for Nvidia . AMD and Huawei are developing next-generation AI-GPUs of their own for sale in high-compute data centers . Nvidia can lose out on future data center real estate to these internally developed chips .  Nvidia's Hopper (H100) chip was commanding north of $40,000 in early 2024, compared to $10,000 to $15,000 per chip for AMD's Instinct series chips . As competition has manifested in the AI arena, Nvidia's gross margin has declined in each quarter since peaking a year ago .  Appaloosa's 13F depicts more selling than buying activity during the March-ended quarter . David Tepper did pick out more than a half-dozen new stocks to add to his fund . If an AI bubble were to form and burst, Broadcom wouldn't be immune .  Broadcom is one of the leading providers of wireless chips and accessories used in smartphones . The expansion of 5G wireless networks leads to relatively steady demand for Broadcom's chips . Broadcom has its fingers in a number of other key industries that would help partially insulate it in the event of an AI bubble .

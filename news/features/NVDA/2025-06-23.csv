" Nvidia is considered an international leader in the design and manufacturing of computer chips and helped revolutionize the rise of artificial intelligence . The company announced plans this March for aquantum research center in Boston .  RIVA 128 allowed for support of high-resolution 2D and 3D graphics, and over a million units sold in its first four months of sales . Two years later, onJan. 22, 1999, Nvidia went public on the New York Stock Exchange at $12 a share .  In 1999, Nvidia released GeForce 256, the world’s first “Graphics Processing Unit.” By marketing the chip directly to customers, the chip popularized the term “GPU” Nvidia joined the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 in 2001 .  Nvidia's CUDA chip allows users to use chips for purposes other than gaming . Investors initially gave the company the benefit of the doubt for the first five years of the CUDA investment . Later technological developments would make CUDA crucial to Nvidia .  In 2012, students used CUDA to train the visual-recognition neural networkAlexNet with two Nvidia GPUs . The breakthrough performance in identifying images demonstrated that using GPUs to train machine learning models cut training times significantly .  In March 2022, Nvidia announced the H100 ‘Hopper’ chip, promising faster training and better performance . Major companies, including Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) turned to Nvidia with billions as they began to develop AI and data-driven products . In November 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a language model built on Nvidia GPUs that quickly reached headlines .  Nvidia's revenue for the quarter ending in January 2024 more than doubled year over year . The company announced a 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024 . Nvidia announced its next chip, Blackwell, in March 2023 .  Nvidia passed Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company at $3.3 trillion . In 2018, it faced a class-action lawsuitalleging it did not properly disclose to investors the impact of the cryptocurrency market on revenue from sales of its GPUs . Nvidia paid a$5.5 million settlement in 2022 to the SEC because of the issue .  Global chip shortage occurred in early 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and an increased reliance on technology for remote work . President Trump announcedProject Stargate in January 2025, which involves tech companies such as Oracle (ORCL), OpenAI, and SoftBank (SFTBY) investing $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the United States over the next four years .  In April 2025, Trump banned the export of Nvidia's H20 chip to China . Nvidia stock dropped $589 billion, almost 17%, marking the largest single-day loss in stock market history .  ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood: “We think it's still going to play a mighty role"" ARK has a history of investing in technology startups .",neutral,"gpu, nvidia, gpus, geforce, cuda"
" Nvidia Inc. stock is cheap based on free cash flow (FCF) price targets . Investors can short out-of-the-money (OTM) NVDA put options to make a 1-month 2.4% yield . This is at 5% lower exercise prices, providing a cheaper potential buy-in point for investors .  Nvidia's Q1 FCF of $26.125 billion represented an astounding 59.3% of quarterly revenue . That means almost 60% of its sales revenue goes straight into its bank account with no cash outlays on it . Over the last 12 months (LTM), its FCF margin was almost 50% (48.5%) That implies going forward its FCf could rise to a record high .  Nvidia's strong FCF and FCF margins will lead to a significantly higher price, between$162and$178 per share . This coincides with what other analysts are projecting . For example, 66 analysts have an average price target of $172.60 .  One way to play this is to sell short out-of-the-money (OTM) puts in nearby expiry periods . In my May 30 Barchart article, I suggest selling short the $128 strike price put expiring July 3 for a3.125% yield . Today, that strike price has a much lower premium of just 39 cents .  The $137 strike price put options expiring July 25 have a $3.40 midpoint premium . That means a new short seller of these puts can make a2.48% yield over the next month . For less risk-averse investors, a 2.70% yield is possible at the $138 strike price .  Investors can potentially make over a 2% yield over the next month shorting these out-of-the-money (OTM) puts . Given the target price of $172.60, the breakeven point presents a potential upside of over 29% .",positive,"nvidia, stock, investors, revenue, quarterly"

" Nvidia's upcoming annual shareholder meeting is unlikely to move the needle for the stock . However, buying Nvidia stock hand over fist could still be a good idea . The next scheduled event that could be a key catalyst is the Q2 update on Aug. 27, 2025 .  Next up is a vote on advisory approval of executive compensation, commonly referred to as ""say-on-pay"" This allows shareholders to voice approval or disapproval of Nvidia's executive compensation plan for the next year . The vote isn't binding on the board of directors .  Nvidia's board recommended shareholders vote against these proposals . Even if the proposals are approved, though, none would affect the stock . The next scheduled event that could cause shares to rise won't be until the company reports its fiscal results .  Nvidia would need to blow past earnings estimates or reveal something else that's really positive to have a significant effect on the stock . The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is only in its early stages, and the rise of AI agents could provide a significant tailwind for Nvidia .  Nvidia's growth will justify its current valuation . Investors won't miss the opportunity if they don't buy the stock before June 25 .

" Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, TSMC, and ASML are all strong plays on expanding AI infrastructure . Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are three tech titans set to benefit from AI . Palantir and Salesforce are two leading software companies that have big AI opportunities ahead .  AMD has become a leader in central processing units (CPUs), which act as the brains of the operation, within the data center . The company has also carved out a niche for its GPUs with AI inference, which is less technically demanding than training AI models .  Broadcom sees its three furthest-along customers as having between a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market in fiscal 2027 . This is a huge opportunity for Broadcom . While the above three companies design advanced AI chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSMC)is the one they hire to actually make them .  ASML has a virtual monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography . It also introduced its next-generation technology, high-NA (numerical aperture) EUV, that will allow for higher density chips . While TSMC has balked at the high price ($400 million) of these new machines, it cannot afford to get bypassed on the technological front by a competitor likeIntel .  Amazon is using AI throughout its e-commerce operations to make its business more efficient and reduce costs . Meta Platforms has been at the forefront of AI with its Llama large language model (LLM) Meta platforms are using AI to keep users more engaged on its social media apps .  Palantir Technologies has taken a different approach to AI, essentially looking to become the orchestration layer, or operating system, for the technology . It does this by gathering data from a wide array of sources and structuring it into an ontology that connects digital assets with their real-world counterparts . This then allows its customers to use its platform to solve complex problems through the use of AI .  Salesforce is now looking to become the leader in agentic AI, where AI agents will go out and perform tasks with little to no human interaction . As a consumption-based solution, AI agents are a huge opportunity for the company .  The Motley Fool is issuing “Double Down’s alerts for three incredible companies .

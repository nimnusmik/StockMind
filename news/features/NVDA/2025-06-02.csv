" Decoding a public company’s earnings report in the 24 hours after its release could be maddening . Look at the 20% plunge Gap's (GAP) stock took on Friday after the company reported across-the-board beats but issued a tariff warning . Gap CEO Richard Dickson made a compelling caseon the state of the business on Yahoo Finance .  Nvidia has earned a legion of fans on Wall Street through years of years of success . The company posted a second (adjusted) EPS figure of $0.96 after excluding ""H20 charge and related tax impact"" Nvidia's China business went poof courtesy of Trump's chip export control .  Analysts have been quick to “exclude” the fall of its once lucrative China business . The uncertainty of the China impact led analysts to estimate figures that included and didn't include the H20 loss .  Nvidia's China loss will put pressure on all other areas of the operation to accelerate in the near term, medium term, and long term . I dig what Jensen said about the potential for robotics . I'm just not sure it's going to drastically drive Nvidia's business in the next eight quarters .",positive,"nvidia, stock, tariff, china, earnings"

Broadcom has $66 billion in long-term debt . It has toyed with the idea of buying(INTC), which would be a challenge if it can't sell Intel's foundry business . President Trump has accused China of violating a tariff pause agreed to earlier this month in Switzerland .

In the recent quarter, gross margin settled at 71.3%, excluding the impact of a $1 billion charge related to chips meant for export to China . Nvidia expects gross margins of 71.8% and 72% in the second quarter .  Nvidia has delivered strong profitability and aims to continue doing so . The company still faces some headwinds, particularly U.S. restrictions on chip exports to China . The ongoing demand for its products and services should keep that momentum on track .

Amazon is building out an AI ecosystem on AWS, including Bedrock, a platform for developing generative AI applications . Analysts estimate Amazon will grow earnings by an average of 17% annually .  Qualcomm's longtime client,Apple, appears poised to stop using its smartphone chipsets in the iPhone . Qualcomm's ties to China could put pressure on the stock if U.S.-China relations continue to deteriorate . DeepSeek's breakthrough dramatically lowered the cost of developing AI models .  Qualcomm generated $22.6 billion in revenue in the first two quarters of fiscal 2025, 17% higher than year-ago levels . It sells at a P/E ratio of 15, even after bouncing off the 52-week lows reached in early April . Investors may want to buy Qualcomm's potential to transform parts of the AI industry .

" The company's popular CUDA software ecosystem provides it with a significant competitive advantage . Enterprises are rapidly adopting Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs, which offer better price performance . Planned purchases by big customers like the Stargate project and Saudi Arabia's new AI company, HUMAIN, will strengthen Nvidia's position in the global AI landscape .  Revenue soared 69% year-over-year to $44.1 billion, while data center revenue surged 73% . Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market should remain unchallenged for the next few years .  Nvidia is sampling GB300 systems at major cloud service providers and expects production shipments to commence by the end of the second quarter . GB300 offer 50% more high-bandwidth memory capacity and a 50% increase in inference computing performance . The company's comprehensive CUDA parallel programming platform is currently used by 5.9 million developers .  Nvidia partnered with Humain, a newly launched AI company owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, to build AI factories with 18,000 of its latest GB300 Blackwell chips in the first deployment phase . Nvidia is also playing a key role in the Stargate Project, through which OpenAI,SoftBank, andOracle said they plan to invest $500 billion into U.S.-based AI infrastructure over the next four years .

With a top line of $808 billion, that would give it a net income of around $225 billion that year .

" Apple was the largest company by market cap for more than a decade but recently was dethroned by Microsoft and Nvidia . The company is growing sales much slower than Nvidia or Microsoft . Apple's slow growth and risks to its earnings mean it will likely not regain its market cap leadership position .  Microsoft and Nvidia are benefiting immensely from AI and its impact on demand for cloud computing and semiconductor products . Apple has failed to capture any share of these rapidly growing sectors, which is why these other ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are charging ahead of it in market capitalization .  Microsoft and Nvidia have grown EPS at a much faster pace than Apple while Apple's EPS has barely budged in the last few years . Apple may see its EPS fall over the next few years because of its high-margin services and software revenue is under attack from antitrust lawsuits .  I think it is unlikely that Apple will reclaim its throne atop the market cap leaderboard . It has minimal growth avenues to drive revenue higher while a company like Nvidia is posting 69% year-over-year revenue growth in its latest quarterly results .

Nvidia cites third-party estimates that data center capital expenditures will rise from $400 billion in 2024 to $1 trillion by 2028 .

CoreWeave is much smaller than Nvidia, at a market cap of $60 billion, and its stock is more volatile .

Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks like Palantir, Nvidia, and Meta Platforms have been major drivers of this bull market .

The Roundhill Generative AI and Technology ETF holds a concentrated portfolio of the world's top AI stocks . Investors can buy a single share in the ETF for under $50 .  The AI industry is still in its infancy so the list of quality companies in those three segments is very short .

Palantir has a market capitalization of $288 billion as of this writing . It's headed to a $1 trillion valuation over the next two or three years . Demand has soared for its AI software platforms like Gotham, Foundry, and AIP .  The Roundhill ETF doesn't have a very long track record because it was only established in May 2023 . It's up by 68% over that period, which is much better than the 40% gain in the S&P 500 index in the same period . With that said, investors are paying a premium for that outperformance .

The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides passive exposure to the stock market's biggest companies . It's the largest of its kind with over $650 billion in assets under management .

" Nvidia currently faces a halt on sales to the country that made up 13% of its revenue last year . The Biden administration in 2022 launched export controls, limiting the types of AI chips that could be sold to the major market . The Trump administration recently revoked the diffusion rule, but said it would replace it with other guidelines soon .  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered a startling message during the recent earnings call . He said the company could no longer sell its previously approved H20 chips to the Chinese market due to a U.S. government rule . China represented 13% of Nvidia's revenue in the last fiscal year .  Nvidia's market share in China has declined from 95% about four years ago to 50% today . As a result, Nvidia was left with H20s it was unable to export, and it announced a $5.5 billion charge linked to that .  Nvidia may lose access to China permanently, and this could weigh on its ability to grow . But two elements make me optimistic this scenario won't play out . Huang generally is very resourceful and proactive, and may find ways to limit the damage .  A complete halt to China sales would hurt Nvidia's growth, but the company continues to advance in other areas throughout the world . I'm optimistic a middle-of-the-road solution may be found, allowing Nvidia at least some opportunity in China, and if this happens, Nvidia shares could soar .

" Nvidia's generative AI business is still doing well, but growth seems to be stalling . New technologies like self-driving cars and robotics could be the key to its long-term success . There are already signs that its AI chip business could be slowing .  Nvidia shares have never surpassed their all-time high reached in 2000 . The company's revenue growth has decelerated to 69% (down from 262% last fiscal quarter) There are early signs that its AI hardware business might be starting to cool .  Customers are increasingly turning to in-house solutions for their AI hardware needs . Nvidia's expertise in designing and producing cutting-edge computer chips will give it an advantage in opportunities outside of just generative AI .  Nvidia's automation and robotics segment has already started to pick up, with first-quarter sales jumping 72% year over year to $567 million . Nvidia can maintain a dominant position because of its vast scale andcompetitive moatin advanced computer hardware design .

" Celebrity investor Kevin O'Learysays the window to buy TikTok with its current Chinese-owned algorithm has officially closed . TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, is under pressure from a U.S. law enacted last year that requires it to sell its TikTok assets in the US . The law was upheld by the Supreme Court, but enforcement has been delayed .  A group led by billionaireFrank McCourt and Reddit co-founderAlexis Ohanian is proposing a new version of TikTok without Chinese-owned code . Critics say the move avoids a key national security concern: the Chinese government could access American user data . Beijing denies this, but many U.S. lawmakers remain skeptical .  O'Leary also tied the TikTok debate to the broader issue of U.S. technology exports, especially AI chips made by companies like Nvidia and AMD . He used a bee analogy to explain: The chip is the queen bee, and software developers are the honeybees building AI — or ""honey"" on that chip .  TikTok could be pulled from U.S. app stores after the September deadline . O'Leary believes this is likely the ""last extension"" Lawmakers debate national security, global trade, and personal privacy .  The stock market has been in a steady decline in recent months .

" CFRA analyst Angelo Zino upgraded AMD stock from a “Buy’ to a ‘Strong Buy’ rating . The upgrade centers on AMD’s upcoming MI400x launch and transition to rack-scale solutions, which Zino believes will help “close the competitive gap” with Nvidia in the lucrative AI accelerator market .  AMD is a formidable force in the rapidly evolving AI landscape through strategic partnerships, accelerated product development, and comprehensive system-level solutions . AMD’s MI350 series represents a significant leap forward, delivering 35 times the performance improvements in inference workloads . The timing appears favorable as the GPU server market is expected to recover sharply in Q4, providing AMD with revenue upside .  AMD is expanding beyond hyperscaler partnerships to target enterprise customers directly . CEO Dr. Lisa Su emphasized AMD’s commitment to providing flexible, programmable solutions as AI algorithms continue evolving rapidly . AMD maintains its annual product cadence, with the MI400 series planned for 2026 .  AMD’s comprehensive approach positions the tech giant to capitalize on the multihundred-billion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity . Analysts tracking AMD stock expect revenue to increase from $25.8 billion in 2024 to $56.4 billion in 2029 . Today, AMD stock trades at 35.5x forward earnings .

" AMD sees the market for its GPUs climbing more than 60% per year through 2028 . It's in position to take a growing share of that market as well as the server CPU market . On the other hand, Arista should see a big sales boost from bigger AI data centers .  AMD's data center revenue totaled just $12.6 billion last year . That's more than 60% annual growth from 2025 to 2028 . AMD introduced several new products at its Advancing AI event earlier this month .  AMD's data center revenue increased 57% last quarter versus Nvidia's 73% increase . AMD's strong position in data center CPUs could also make it a staple for years to come . AMD currently trade for about 37 times forward earnings estimates .  Arista makes network switches that can scale up to huge AI accelerator clusters while maintaining high data-transfer speeds . The company's equipment helps ensure limited downtime for the expensive AI accelerator chips lining the server racks of AI data centers . EOS makes it easier for data center operators to get the most out of their equipment .  Nvidia is starting to encroach on Arista's market with the introduction of its Spectrum-X networking platform . The system is designed to work with its GPU clusters, taking advantage of Nvidia's dominant position in the chip market . As spending on AI accelerators climbs toward that $500 billion-plus estimate from AMD's management, Arista should benefit .  AMD's profit margins are already relatively high compared to the likes of Nvidia, which may limit operating leverage . With the stock trading for about 37 times forward earnings expectations, that makes it just as expensive as AMD . But analysts don't see earnings rising at the same rate as AMD's .

From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue and earnings per share to grow at 19% and 15% . That growth should be driven by the soaring need for cloud and AI infrastructure upgrades, its gradual expansion into the enterprise and campus markets .

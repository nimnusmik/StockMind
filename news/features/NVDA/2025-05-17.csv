The trip was also an opportunity to reemphasize the influence of Elon Musk .  The focus on semiconductors and artificial intelligence was perhaps the biggest business-world focus of the highly anticipated trip . Trump eased restrictions on artificial intelligence chip exports to Saudi Arabia during a meeting with Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman . Other CEOs voiced concerns about the global economy in the wake of trade war .  This week also saw Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk remind the world of his closeness to Trump . The theme of business investment was repeated again and again, even coming up in some unexpected places .  Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa expressed a hope for increased trade with U.S. companies to invest in Syrian oil and gas . During a back-and-forth with reporters, the president didn't even dismiss the notion of new relations with Syria leading to a potential Trump Tower in Damascus, saying, ""We'll have to wait a little while until things calm down"" Critics say the trip tore down ethical boundaries between Trump's public duties and personal interests .

" Nvidia stock has jumped 27% in the past three weeks, thanks to positive reports from tech giants that use Nvidia's AI chips . The chipmaker's upcoming results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (which ended April 27), which will be announced on May 28 .  The U.S. and China have agreed on bringing down the reciprocal tariffs by 115% for a period of 90 days . This comes in the wake of China's rollback of tariffs on imports of microchips from the US . Earlier, President Donald Trump had indicated he was willing to reduce duties on Chinese imports .  Nvidia customer Meta Platforms indicated it was ready to bear the increase in costs of AI hardware thanks to the tariff imposition . There were reports last month that memory manufacturer Micron Technology was imposing a tariff-fueled surcharge on some of its products to account for the increased costs .  Analysts are expecting Nvidia to deliver $43 billion in revenue for fiscal Q1, an improvement of 65% from the year-ago period . However, a surge in orders from Chinese clients could help Nvidia's top line exceed those expectations . The likes of ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent placed orders for at least $16 billion worth of Nvidia's H20 AI GPUs in the first three months of 2025 .  Nvidia's revenue has been attributed to an increase in demand for low-cost AI models .

" President Donald Trump's flurry of artificial intelligence deals during his tour of the Middle East is opening a rift within his own administration . China hawks grow increasingly concerned the projects are putting US national security and economic interests at risk . The Trump team has worked out agreements for parties in Saudi Arabia to acquire tens of thousands of semiconductors .  Some senior administration officials are seeking to slow down the deals over concerns the US hasn’t imposed sufficient guardrails to prevent American chips shipped to the Gulf from benefiting China . China hawks also have grown alarmed over what they see as a willingness by White House AI Adviser David Sacks to entertain proposals from Gulf leaders .  If the deals all come to fruition, the US would still hold the vast majority of the world’s computing power . Gulf countries would for the first time have significant capabilities powered by best-in-class US hardware .  Advocates for the deals argue that if the US doesn’t encourage the world to use American chips, countries with AI ambitions will eventually turn to alternatives from Chinese companies . “The only question you need to ask is: does China wish it had made these deals? Yes of course it does,” Sacks wrote on X.com .  Several senior officials have discussed strategies for slowing implementation of Gulf AI agreements, people say . One concern is a bilateral accord between the US and UAE that could include a massive project by OpenAI .  All AI chip shipments to the Gulf require approval through a licensing process involving several federal agencies . Administration officials are also in the middle of drafting global semiconductor export control rules after tossing out a framework introduced by President Joe Biden .  The UAE and Saudi Arabia offered a combined $2.4 trillion in US investments that helped pave the way for the recent AI . Some officials in both the Trump and Biden administrations have argued that America’s technological lead is quite large and enables Washington to write the rules of the road .  Some senior administration officials have grown wary of negotiating positions adopted by Sacks . Sacks expressed openness to UAE housing a production facility from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The UAE has long coveted such a plant and asked the US government for its support as part of the broader chip accord .  Some US officials remain wary of G42’s commitment to American priorities . G42 agreed to divest from Huawei and other Chinese providers to pave the way for a $1.5 billion partnership with Microsoft . Now the Trump administration is considering an agreement that would allow G42 to buy the equivalent of more than a million Nvidia H100 accelerators .  Sacks has been angling to steer efforts to write the fine print, people say . The US delegation shot down that suggestion in the meeting, but after the fact, Sacks suggested that Trump’s team should evaluate the idea . Saudi officials suggested they may install US chips in facilities that contain Huawei hardware .  Sacks: ""All one would have to do is send someone to a data center and count the server racks to make sure the chips are still there.” The idea is not part of the current accord, people familiar with the matter said .

" President Trump set out a broad framework early last month, including double-digit tariffs on countries worldwide and a tariff on China that reached 145% . The concern was high tariff levels would weigh on the economy and even lead to a recession . But when Trump halted the plan for 90 days to allow for negotiations with countries, indexes rebounded .  Among the biggest gainers in the market were tech stocks . Tech companies rely heavily on manufacturing abroad . A satisfactory trade deal between the U.S. and China suggests any tariffs on electronics also would be manageable .  Amazon says it's already taken steps to manage the situation, including buying inventory early to lower prices . This means agreements with lower-than-expected tariffs represent good news for Amazon . Third-party sellers on Amazon may have different strategies -- some may pass costs on to customers .  Nvidia has become the name that's practically synonymous with AI chips . The company is the world's top seller of AI chips and has developed an entire ecosystem of related products and services . This has helped Nvidia generate double- and triple-digit quarterly revenue growth .  Nvidia has been taking action to control the level of risk presented by tariffs . The idea that tariffs in general may be much lower than originally expected is fantastic news for the company . Nvidia is positioned to benefit from this new tariff climate, making it a solid stock to own right now .  High tariff levels represented a risk for both Amazon and Nvidia -- and today, the worst-case scenario has disappeared, replaced by a situation that should be much more manageable . That makes both of these stocks a great buy at the moment, but considering valuation, Nvidia gets extra points .

" Lucas Harper; Chief Investment Officer, Gregory Haskell; Chief Executive Officer, Director; Dino Foderaro; Chief Revenue Officer; Accelsius David Yablunosky; Chief Financial Officer; Nehal Chokshi; Analyst; Chip Moore; ROTH Capital Partners Operator .  Certain statements being made today are forward looking statements that are based on management’s current assumptions, beliefs and expectations concerning future events impacting the company . The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the differences are available in our earnings release and supplemental slide presentation on our website .  Accelsius has tremendous momentum, but it is important to provide additional context on the compelling market opportunity that underpins a large part of the venture’s value creation potential . AeroFlexx and Refinitiv continue to execute on their respective strategies . We are excited to share more about both as we move through 2025 .  Innventure’s goal is to build companies that we believe can achieve a minimum of $1 billion in enterprise value . As CRO, Kimo leads the client operations group, applying his operations background to driving execution and ensuring a premier customer experience .  There are many exciting things happening at Accelsius. There are a few key secular tailwinds happening in the data center industry . This highly attractive market was one of the key factors in Inventor’s decision to commercialize the two phase direct to chip technology .  According to Dell’Oro Group, worldwide data center spending was roughly $450 billion in 2024 . That number is expected to grow to over $1 trillion by 2029 . In the short term, single phase water based technologies are expected to expand their share of the liquid cooling market .  Accelsius new cool technology is superior to single phase water based technologies . Data center operators and end users that currently employ traditional air cooling can experience a drastic improvement in power usage effectiveness . NuCool can reduce the amount of power used for cooling by more than 80% .  NuCool technology allows AI data center customers in Singapore the ability to utilize free cooling 97% of the time in comparison to 34% with single phase technologies . Data center operators are increasingly recognizing the benefits of leapfrogging air cooling solutions .  AI focused chipsets expected to enter the market in late twenty twenty twenty five and 2026 . NVIDIA’s five year product roadmap shows near term rack densities anticipated to eclipse 250 kilowatts per rack . Other chip and server OEMs are targeting configurations landing at one megawatt per rack before 2030 .  The current liquid cooling market is estimated at 1,300,000,000 and growing at an annual rate of approximately 30% . The Dell’Oro Group estimates that the market will grow to a $5 billion market by 2028 .  Use of nonconductive dielectric fluid allows us to handle future generations of processors with increased confidence . We provide peace of mind with two and five year limited warranty options and offer additional coverage that replaces server electronics .  Accelsius has three products with several more in development . Technology can run-in an environment with up to 45 degree c facility water supply, dependent on processor and rack configuration . This allows operators to run chillers less and utilize free cooling .  Accelsius's flexible solutions can be deployed within existing data center infrastructures, brownfield sites, without significant costs or downtime . Only one other player in the market today offers a viable two phase direct to chip liquid cooling technology .  Accelsius is focused on building relationships with four key groups, hyperscalers and multinational OEMs, global resellers, colocation providers, and AI as a service provider, also referred to as Neo Clouds .  Winning the confidence and volume orders from a hyperscale customer is a deliberate multi phase process that requires alignment across numerous internal stakeholders . The process typically begins with lab testing, followed by formal proof of concept deployments .  Accelsius is seeing steady traction, strong engagement, and continued momentum as our technology proves itself in the field . It should be noted that these global OEMs generate billions of dollars of revenue and require significant volumes .  NVIDIA recently rolled out their GPU roadmap for the next several years . The necessary computing power needed to enable AI is undeniable . Accelsius is well positioned to fulfill that need when it arises .  NVIDIA’s rollout has coincided with an explosion of interest in Accelsius over the last sixty days or so . Marketing lead generation has spiked over 300% in 2025 compared to the prior trailing four month period .  The average proposal size at the end of twenty twenty four was typically for single unit proof of concept systems . Today, proposals average between 2 million and 4 million which demonstrates the Accelsius inclusion and full scale production .  Innventure expects to achieve significant operating leverage if we receive orders that ramp into the thousands and tens of thousands of racks . Innventure is focused on partnering with partners to meet anticipated market needs .  When Accelsius receives a large scale order, fulfillment planning is already well underway . We can’t disclose specifics like the company name or anticipated volume .  Liquid cooling market is sizable and growing and is estimated to reach $5 billion within the next three years . Industry players believe adoption of liquid cooling will be all but required and Accelsius is at the forefront with the leading technology .  Innventure’s first quarter revenue was $0.2 million representing management fees we collected from our management of the InVentus ESG fund . This was in line with our expectations and consistent with our communication on our expectations .  There is a significant unmet market need for two phase direct to chip liquid cooling, and we believe Accelsius is well positioned at the forefront of adoption of this technology . G and A expenses were approximately $20 million for the quarter .  The company booked a $233 million non-cash goodwill adjustment, driven by the write down of goodwill on the balance sheet . This was a result of the decrease in the company’s share price and market capitalization . EBITDA was a loss of approximately $248 million .  2025 will represent an inflection point for revenue growth at Accelsius, we believe . We expect to see the results of this revenue and earnings growth in our consolidated financial statements in future quarters .  Inventory remained steady from the end of the prior quarter at approximately $5.2 million . We received gross proceeds of $18 million on April 14 and $9 million on May 15 . This added $27 million of cash to our balance sheet .  The cash used in investing activities primarily represents funding given to AeroFlexx through our existing facility comprised of debt securities . The cash provided by financing activities section includes approximately $8.2 million of net cash raised through the Innventure Series C preferred stock round .  With the white label agreement with the OEM, that was that primarily driven by a end hyperscaler engagement? Gregory Haskell I think it’s broader than that, Nehal. I can flip this over to Dino in just a second .  The relationship started from specifications that drove towards a larger market . Now we do see hyperscalers being able to use this, Neo Clouds being able . as well as other users of the data center. of customers. Nehal Chokshi .  Gregory Haskell: There we certainly expect some volume from those agreements, there’s a much, much broader pool of customers that we’re engaged with . Our activity is kind of through the roof right now in terms of the activity .  Naho had six of these partners in January and now it’s 21. So all of those have the ability to they’re all channels of one form or another . I think that slowdown in the first half was attributable to a number of factors, mostly tariffs, uncertainty and then Nvidia putting out their roadmap in late February .  Since that inflection point, it’s been, as you can see in the data, a significant ramp up in activity . When you have pool boiling, you really have no excess for any overload or any hiccup in the facility water supply . Whereas the flow boiling, we always have ample fluid flowing through the cold plates and through the system that allow that additional headroom or a little bit of extra buffer .  The pump power being below the threshold set by the OEMs of that 1.5%, two %, really the benefit that you get from having that resiliency, that robustness, is the resiliability . However, when you look at the cost associated with extra fluid, especially with the fluids that we're utilizing, which are commercially available, are relatively low cost fluids .  Nehal Chokshi: There are some hot spots on the Blackwall architecture, which could be a potential accelerant towards phase DLC . Gregory Haskell: We see that trade off being a no brainer going towards the flow side.  I think the tone around revenue inflection certainly sounds like you’re feeling more positive on sort of near term trajectory . Maybe just expand on that pretty notable increase in lead generation there since February . And you talked about fulfillment, you know, being able to be pretty quickly just maybe talk about potential leapfrog single phase sort of is better now needed later type mentality how those conversations are going .  NVIDIA’s roadmap that was released at GTC and then released even further at some of the conferences following that, really gave direction to the data center operators, the infrastructure manufacturers, and those that are kind of in the know on that .  There was a very small amount of liquid cooling deployments that had actually been achieved in the prior years outside of the hyperscalers . As enterprise clients as colos started to deploy more of the single phase water, those problems, those issues that are inherent to that technology really came to roost and people got to feel those personally . And that drove a large amount of attention and really kind of opened up the market to what we’ve been evangelizing over the last few years .  Chip Moore: ""Two phases are gonna be needed to the people that are the experts, the subject matter experts at the the polos, the OEMs, the people . that are actually deploying the cooling, the MEP firms, design firms to how do I deploy this? Your solution is viable. What is the way that we get this into our data centers? That’s really, like I said, the drive and the paradigm shift, the types of conversations that we’ve had, pointed at that inflection point and that wave coming out of Accelsius .  Centimeters partner and Centimeters partners have really come in to drive a lot of that confidence and help ensure that we can support those large volumes, as well as ensuring that those volumes can be met with quality that’s expected in a tech market .  The three sixty approach that we took, I think has lent very good confidence or gained very strong confidence from our clients. from the manufacturing side. The fact that we’ve had in some cases a dozen meetings or more with various . clients, or they’re confident based on the interactions they have had with us or they wouldn’t be coming back.  Large type scalers suggests that they see this as a viable path to getting to scale . And of course, they understand that we’re partnering with content manufacturers to handle the larger volumes . But even internally with the kind of volumes we talked about, we can still get to some pretty meaningful size .  We believe that there’s, again, a lot of momentum going on in the company in all of our opening companies. come on to talk more in detail about Accelsius. We do look forward to future updates. Quite honestly, I feel that we're very well positioned and they’re all really maturing .",neutral,"enterprise, firms, companies, venture, securities"

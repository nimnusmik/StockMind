" Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company unveils $100 billion investment in Arizona . TSMC produces more than 90% of the world’s advanced semiconductor chips that power everything from smartphones to weapons .  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said “the importance of advanced packaging for AI is very high” Huang: “No one has pushed advanced packaging harder than me” because of the AI boom .  Advanced packaging keeps afloat Moore’s Law, the idea that the number of transistors on microchips would double every two years, as breakthroughs in the chip fabrication process become increasingly costly and more difficult . CoWoS, short for Chips on Wafer-on-Wafer, invented by TSMC, is arguably the best known that was thrown under the limelight .  CoWoS is indispensable to producing AI processors, such as the GPUs produced by Nvidia and AMD that are used in AI servers or data centers . TSMC is scrambling to ramp up production capacity .  Analysts say having both pieces of that jigsaw in Arizona means the US will have a ‘one-stop shop’ for chip production and a strengthened position for its AI arsenal . Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm and Broadcom are some of TSMC’s top clients .  Chiang proposed developing the technology in 2009 in an attempt to fit more transistors into chips and solve bottlenecks in performance . When it was developed, few companies took up the technology because of the high cost associated with it . But the AI boom turned CoWoS around, making it one of the most popular technologies . “The result was beyond our original expectation,” Chiang said .  Taiwan's ASE Group and SPIL are all key players in advanced packaging technologies . Taiwan’s ASE group is one of the world's leading packaging companies .",neutral,"processors, microchips, wafer, manufacturing, amd"

" Difficult market times may present an opportunity -- if you know how to plan for and manage them . It's nearly impossible to time the market, so you're unlikely to buy a stock at its lowest and sell at its highest . To win in a tough market and beyond, it's important to invest for the long term .  You can buy stocks during a downturn because, by holding on for five years or more, you're giving those companies time to recover and grow . TheS&P 500 index has slid into the correction zone 15 times since 2008 . In all but two of those times, the index was in correction zone .  The message here is not to hesitate to buy stocks during a correction . History shows that it's been a great bet for long-term investors . It's impossible to know when the market will enter its next negative phase, but it will occur at some point .  TheMSCI World Value Index outperformed theMSci World Growth Index by more than 26% in 2022 . Value stocks are in well-established industries, such as energy, healthcare, or financials . They generate a considerable amount of cash and pay dividends .  If you have a certain amount of money to invest, you could deploy it all at once in a lump sum or use cost averaging . A study by Vanguard shows that lump-sum investing beats cost averaging 68% of the time . In the worst market environments, lump sum investing resulted in bigger losses .  The Vanguard study also found that both techniques outperformed cash at least 69% of the time . This means that, even in the most difficult of environments, if you're willing to hold on for the long term, you're better off investing than staying out of the market .

" Investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure is expected to reach nearly $7 trillion by next decade . As demand for data centers, network equipment, and chips continue to rise, so does access to this infrastructure . Nebius Group offers a unique cloud-based solution for AI developers seeking access to high-performance AI training and inferencing .  Nebius operates across four segments . The company's core business is an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) business . Nebius has three subsidiaries: Avride, Toloka, and TripleTen . Avride is emerging force in the autonomous vehicle industry . Toloka serves as data partner for large language models (LLMs) and AI developers .  Nebius is a diversified business positioned to benefit from AI in many different ways . The company works closely with Nvidia, allowing its customers to access a series of different GPU architectures . At the end of the first quarter, Nebius' IaaS business was operating at a $249 million annual recurring revenue run rate .  Nebius appears to have strong secular tailwinds fueling its long-run growth narrative . The company is also building out new infrastructure in Iceland, Kansas City, and New Jersey . Nebius was actually spun out of a Russian internet conglomerate called Yandex .  Nebius is flying under the radar -- completely overshadowed by CoreWeave's popularity . I see robust growth ahead for Nebius both in the short and long run, and I think the company's growth will continue .  Nebius Group's relationships with Nvidia and others in the AI landscape could lead to larger, more strategic deals over time .

" Tesla is planning to launch its first Robotaxi rides in Austin next month . The company is one of the biggest laggards in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks isTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), whose shares have declined 15% year to date (as of May 15)  Tesla CEO Elon Musk is committed to launching the first Robotaxi rides next month in Austin, Texas . Musk's vision isn't just for Tesla to sell electric vehicles, but he has his sights set on building an autonomous vehicle fleet .  A core part of the AI thesis around Tesla is rooted in the Robotaxi business being successful . Musk signaled to investors that ""the real question from [a] financial standpoint is when does it really become material and affect [the] bottom line""  If Tesla does indeed launch Robotaxi next month in Austin, my hunch is that shares will skyrocket . Tesla stock has been creeping up as of late -- and there's no clear reason .  If Robotaxi does prove to be a lucrative extension of Tesla's EV business, investors will have ample opportunities to invest in the stock as the business evolves into more of an AI player than a car manufacturer .

Walmart reiterated its full-year earnings per share forecast on Thursday after ratcheting down expectations at an investor event several weeks ago . Executives went on to say they would start raising prices (by raising prices)  If tariffs go back to pre-thaw levels, it may render guidance obsolete . Yet, the guidance is out there . Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz decided to pull guidance altogether because of trade uncertainty . United Airlines (UAL) still has its double guidance range out there(which numerous execs have privately made fun of). Yet despite all the confusion, we have the Street looking for earnings growth north of 10% this year .

To the extent they no longer are, I view it as one more problem for investors to contend with in a challenging 2025 .",negative,"earnings, executives, stocks, stock, forecast"

" Nvidia will continue to benefit from strong global demand for AI infrastructure . Already a leader in the AI training market, Nvidia is also dominating the growing AI inference market . The company's stock has a strong chance of rising after its first-quarter results .  Nvidia is an undisputed leader, accounting for roughly a 90% share of the data center graphics processing unit (GPU) market . The company stands to benefit significantly from the rapid expansion in data center capital expenditures . Many cloud players reiterated their commitments to investing in AI infrastructure, which contradicts the narrative of a potential slowdown in AI spending .  Blackwell has been optimized for running inference workloads, such as computationally intensive reasoning AI or long-term thinking models . Nvidia announced plans to build up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the U.S. within the next four years .  In May 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce revoked the Biden-era AI Diffusion interim rule, which was set to take effect on May 15 . With fewer restrictions on international sales, investors can expect stronger revenue guidance for the rest of fiscal 2026 . With 5.9 million developers in its ecosystem, this has become a solid competitive moat .  Nvidia's revenue growth trajectory has been exceptional for the past few years . The company guided for revenues of $43 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 . Nvidia currently trades at 25.4 times forward earnings, below its five-year average of 69.2 times .  Nvidia's robust AI-optimized ecosystem, cutting-edge technological offerings, and historical tendency to report performance that exceeds guidance, there is a high likelihood that the company will deliver better-than-expected results in the first quarter . The company could also provide strong guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 . With its current valuation, the stock seems well positioned to soar significantly in the coming months .

" Nvidia has a history of beating Wall Street's earnings estimates . Hints from several major customers are encouraging about the demand for Nvidia's GPUs . Strong demand could boost Nvidia's Q1 results and its outlook for the rest of the year .  Nvidia has topped consensus Wall Street earnings estimates in each of the previous four quarters by at least 5%. Granted, an earnings beat doesn't always translate to a bump in Nvidia's share price . But my hunch is that investors are looking for a reason to be bullish about the once high-flying stock again .  Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in his company's Q1 earnings call that Amazon Web Services has been aggressive in installing Nvidia AI chips as well as its own Trainium chips . Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and its parentAlphabet, highlighted Google's ties with Nvidia . CFO Amy Hood said in her Q3 earnings call, that demand is outpacing capacity for AI services .  Nvidia plans to launch its Blackwell Ultra GPU in the second half of this year . Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated in his company's last quarterly update that demand for the new GPUs is ""extraordinary"" Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer Nvidia's B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs to customers .  Nvidia could beat earnings expectations and provide an optimistic outlook for the rest of the year . But if the trade dynamics change for the worse between now and May 28, that might not be enough to propel the stock higher over the near term . Over the long term, I think Nvidia's future remains bright .  Nvidia, Apple, Netflix and Netflix are all about to pop . If you invest $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you'd have $351,127! Nvidia: If you invested in Apple in 2008, you’d have $40,106! Netflix: $642,582! Now is the best time to buy before it's too late .

" Amazon's two growth segments can help propel it to a $10 trillion market cap . Compared to other big tech competitors, it has more room to expand profit margins in the next decade . Amazon's dual growth engines and profit margin expansion potential have the company poised to be the first stock to eclipse a $100 trillion valuation .  Amazon's combined North America and international sales were more than $500 billion over the last year . E-commerce is still less than 20% of retail sales in the United States and has steadily grown for decades . Cloud computing is getting supercharged by artificial intelligence (AI), which is taking the industry to become much bigger .  Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is going to capture the majority of the company's planned $100 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 . I think AWS has a clear path to expand to $200 billion and eventually $300 billion in revenue over the next decade and beyond .  Amazon's combined revenue will eventually reach $2 trillion in the next 10 to 20 years . Amazon's competitors in big tech do not have the large addressable market afforded to Amazon by dominating both e-commerce and cloud computing . Amazon has a much clearer revenue growth path to help it achieve the hundreds of billions of dollars in annual earnings needed to warrant this valuation .  Amazon stock is my bet to be the first stock with a $10 trillion market value . Now is the best time to buy before it’s too late .

Nvidia reported impressive financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, beating estimates .

" Rigetti Computing has emerged as one of the hottest names fueling the quantum computing movement . While its rapid ascent in share price may tempt investors to buy, the company's financial profile suggests the company still has a long way to go .  Rigetti Computing has seen its shares rise by 521% in just the last six months . As the prospects of quantum computing gain more momentum, could Rigetti be on its way to becoming the next Nvidia? The total addressable market for quantum computingis expected to reach $131 billion over the next 15 years .  Quantum computing doesn't have many use cases for today's AI applications . This is underscored by Rigetti's paltry $10.8 million in annual sales . While the market size is expected to grow by billions over the coming years, developing quantum computing technology is going to require hefty investments .  The parabolic rise in Rigetti's stock price is rooted more in momentum trading -- a feature often exhibited by meme stocks .

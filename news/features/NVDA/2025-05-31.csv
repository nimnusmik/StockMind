" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the $50 billion market for AI chips in China is now “effectively closed to U.S. industry’s . Huang: H20 processor, previously approved for China, was required to obtain an export license . The chipmaker booked a $4.5 billion charge for the fiscal first quarter, ended April 27 .  Nvidia is the top supplier of graphics-processing units, which are essential to power and train large AI models worldwide . China remains a key market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year .  Nvidia reported adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share on $44.06 billion in revenue for its fiscal first quarter, beating Wall Street’s expectations . Data-center revenue has grown at a remarkable pace, driven by demand across the U.S., Europe, and the Gulf States . In fiscal 2024, revenue for the data-center segment tripled .  Nvidia forecasts $45 billion, plus or minus 2%, of revenue for the July quarter . Analysts had projected $45.9 billion, but it noted that the figure would have been roughly $8 billion higher without the China export curbs .

" Nvidia reported overall mixed earnings for Q1, topping Wall Street estimates on several key metrics . However, the consensus among analysts seems to be that the results are encouraging enough for investors to proceed with optimism that the chipmaker's growth will continue .  Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, the AI market has grown quickly, and many investors have zeroed in on Nvidia as the undisputed leader . The company has benefited significantly from this, rising steadily as global demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) has trended upward . However, in January 2025, a Chinese AI startup called DeepSeek triggered a massive chip stock selloff when the company released an AI model built on less advanced Nvidia chips .  Nvidia said it expects the H20 licensing requirement to result in an $8 billion revenue hit during Q2, which it projects to be roughly $45 billion . The company also shared that due to this new policy, it had been rendered unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion worth of H20 products during Q1 .  President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance have stressed the need for less regulation on the AI industry . The licensing requirement stands to compromise Nvidia’s quest to continue selling a popular chip in China, a market the company does not want to lose . Now the AI leader is at even greater risk of being pushed out of the Chinese market .  Nvidia stands to lose billions, thanks to new U.S. policy, says Huang . China’s market is critical to the success of any chipmaker . Even if Nvidia can successfully market and sell this new chip in China, it won't be able to recoup the losses it has suffered .",positive,"nvidia, gpus, chipmaker, deepseek, investors"

" Kalshi has taken a battering ram to the regulatory establishment in its bid to give Americans the inalienable right to bet on everything . The seven-year old financial exchange is taking it to a whole new level by using its federal financial license to open up sports gambling nationwide . The move has earned the New York-based prediction market cease-and-desist letters from state gaming agencies .  Kalshi is a high-tech casino operating in a legal gray zone . Co-founders say Wall Street blurred the line between investing and gambling long ago . The company's recent legal victories are bound to stir unease among those who worry about the social harms .  Kalshi. offers around 1,200 markets - up from 300 last fall - and plans to boost that five- to 10-fold this year . They’re still minnows by Wall Street standards, with daily trading volumes measured in millions of dollars .  Kalshi hosted $1 billion of trades on the election . The CFTC argued the firm was running a “Trojan horse’s transformation into a large-scale election gambling market . Since then, though, Mansour and his co-founder have quickly made the journey from spurned outsiders to establishment favorites .  In the founders’ view, prediction markets offer a way for ordinary Americans and financial professionals alike to buy insurance against real-world events . The strategy raises uncomfortable questions for Wall Street, which has sold the idea that markets are about capital formation and price discovery, rather than a casino for speculation .  CFTC co-founder Kalshi met with then president-elect Trump at an Ultimate Fighting Championship bout, adding Donald Trump Jr. as advisor, and co-hosting a party with TikTok to celebrate pro-Trump influencers . Mansour, the more pugnacious and defiant of the two co-founders, hit back at what he referred to as the “woke mob” just three days after inauguration, began listing sports bets for the first time .  79% of Kalshi’s recent volumes have been related to sports, according to analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence . The excitement around the company was evident at an oversubscribed event in April .  Kalshi previously acknowledged that CFTC rules showed “Congress did not want sports betting to be conducted on derivatives markets” The move into sports betting marks an about-face . It’s a far cry from when Mansour and Lopes Lara founded the firm in 2018, soon after graduating from MIT .  Kalshi is based on the humble event contract, which makes it possible to place a binary bet on a particular outcome . The company got a license to be an exchange from the CFTC back in 2020 .  Kalshi does operate its own market maker on the exchange, which trades with customers . The startup’s argument about CFTC authority has been persuasive enough to score preliminary victories in lawsuits against Nevada and New Jersey .  Kalshi's business model has created concerns among Wall Street firms who answer to similar regulators . Polymarket, which operates globally but is banned in the US, has been pulling in bigger numbers . Another player, Crypto.com, has hired a lawyer who worked at the CFTC .  PredictIt, which ran a limited prediction market for years under an academic partnership, says it's optimistic it will receive its CFTC license soon . With sports betting garnering $3.87 billion in gross revenue in the first quarter, the industry looks like a huge opportunity . Flutter Entertainment Plc, which runs FanDuel, sees prediction markets as way to get into sports gambling in states where it's not legal yet .  The structure of prediction markets could make it hard for Kalshi to expand into short-term bets during live games . The startup says sports parlays and wagers on in-game player performance are not on its roadmap . If it succeeds, it could kick open a new asset class to the masses .  Mark Zuckerberg Loves MAGA Now.

NVIDIA CEO: ""Our customers’ commitments are firm"" Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud have insatiable demand for NVIDIA .

As that stack grows to include 6G and quantum, US global infrastructure leadership is at stake . Shielding Chinese chipmakers from US competition only strengthens them abroad .

The deadline for institutional investors overseeing at least $100 million to fileForm 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission was May 15 .  David Tepper of Appaloosa Management traded 130,000 shares in AI-networking specialistBroadcom . Tepper's net-selling of artificial intelligence stocks was his first-quarter trading activity . As of the end of March, Tepper oversaw close to $8.4 billion in assets under management .  Based on Appaloosa's 13F, Tepper sold shares of five prominent artificial intelligence stocks in the March-ended quarter . It's quite possible this selling activity represents nothing more than simple profit-taking . Shares of Nvidia, Microsoft, AMD, Lam Research have all rocketed higher as the AI revolution has taken shape .  The worry is that there may be more than just benign profit-taking and/or stop losses (in Intel's case) behind Tepper's aggressive net selling of AI stocks . On one hand, demand for AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI solutions has been exceptionally strong . Nvidia's Hopper (H100) and Blackwell GPUs hold a seemingly insurmountable market share lead in AI-accelerated data centers . Intel's central processing units are also playing a role in the expansion of AI-data center infrastructure .  Many of Nvidia's largest customers are internally developing AI chips to use in their data centers . This is expected to weigh on Nvidia's pricing power, as well as AMD and possibly even Intel . It also has the potential to adversely impact the pricing power for semiconductor equipment companies like Lam Research .  If the AI bubble were to burst, we'd see widespread weakness among the five prominent AI stocks Tepper completely exited or reduced in the March-ended quarter .

In the event of a downturn, U.S. public finances would suffer the double whammy of shrinking taxreceipts and a surge in benefit payments, pushing the country closer to a fiscal cliff .

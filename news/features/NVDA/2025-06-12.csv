Data center capital expenditures reached $400 billion in 2024, but that same report expects those buildouts to expand to $1 trillion by 2028 . That's incredible growth, but some investors may be a bit skeptical .  In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, Nvidia's revenue rose 69% year over year to $44 billion . Nvidia's guidance for Q2 was reduced by $8 billion because it could not sell H20 chips . Nvidia is still expected to generate $45 billion in revenue during Q2 -- a 50% growth rate .  Wall Street analysts project only 53% revenue growth this year and 26% next year .

Last week, Tesla shares dropped 23% from peak to trough during the public spat between Tesla’s CEO and the US president .  The tension between Musk and Trump has made it hard to gauge how much volatility is expected to come from the launch . The sudden fallout that played out over social media triggered the largest one-day wipe-out in Tesla’s market capitalization .  Tesla's implied volatility is at 65%, the highest of the S&P 500 Index's top 300 stocks . The company’s option volume has overtaken that of Nvidia Corp. sales . Several Wall Street analysts have expressed doubts in the past week about the robotaxi .  Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch lowered profit and sales estimates on the company .

Analyst Ivan Feinseth foresees Nvidia shares adding 55% and heading to $220 . Nvidia's market cap would be near $5.4 trillion . Feineth's Street-high price target is predicated on sustained strong demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs)  Feinseth's $220 price target came after a short-lived plunge in Nvidia stock caused by the debut of DeepSeek's chatbot . Seaport Global Investors analyst Jay Goldberg's price target intimates a decline of almost 30% . Goldberg doesn't foresee Nvidia losing its leading position as the preferred company powering AI-accelerated data centers .  Many of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are internally developing AI-GPUs and solutions of their own . This is potentially problematic to Nvidia landing new orders from its current top customers . Goldberg also believes that enterprise customers will branch out and purchase from other hardware providers .  Since the advent of the internet, we've witnessed a number of other high-profile trends, technologies, and innovations come along that have also endured an early stage bubble-bursting event . This includes genome decoding, business-to-business commerce, nanotechnology, 3D printing, cannabis, blockchain technology, and the metaverse .  Nvidia's sales have skyrocketed from $27 billion to more than $130 billion between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2025 . Most businesses are nowhere close to optimizing their AI solutions as of yet .

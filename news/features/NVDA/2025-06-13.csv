" Nvidia's high valuation could mean limited returns for investors who buy the stock today . A more compelling option recently has been to invest in CoreWeave, a recently listed artificial intelligence stock .  CoreWeave rents out GPU computing capacity . It gives customers access to Nvidia's chips and the resources and infrastructure they need to test and train AI models without having to make the costly infrastructure investments themselves .  CoreWeave's net loss jumped from $129.2 million a year ago to $314.6 million this past quarter . The company's operating expenses totaled more than $1 billion, and its interest costs were sizable at $263.8 million . There's plenty of growth here, but investors should look beyond just the top line .  CoreWeave's stock is performing incredibly well in just its first few months as a public company . Investors should temper expectations as this can be a highly volatile investment, even if you're bullish on AI's long-term growth . This is a stock that will primarily appeal to investors with a high risk tolerance .

" By next year, Berkshire Hathaway will have a new CEO in Greg Abel . Abel may want to put his stamp on the company . There are some solid blue-chip stocks that aren't in Berkshire's portfolio that arguably should be in there already .  With Buffett no longer at the helm, it opens the path for Berkshire to create a position in Microsoft under Abel . Microsoft is the type of business that checks all the boxes for Berkshire . It has solid fundamentals, many growth opportunities and a strong brand that is known all over the world .  Enbridge is known for its consistency and long-term dependability . This year, the company expects to meet or exceed its financial guidance . Buffett has always valued predictability and stability in businesses . The pipeline company generated revenue totaling just under 61 billion Canadian dollars over the trailing 12 months .  For years, iPhone makerApple has been the top holding in Berkshire's portfolio . Apple has arguably been losing its luster due to a fumbled AI rollout and delaying key features on its latest phones . Investing in Nvidia is a move that could make much more sense .  Given its impressive market position and huge profit margins, it seems unfathomable that the stock isn't in Berkshire's portfolio already . Buffett may not want too much exposure to tech or that he's simply too unfamiliar with it . This can be yet another opportunity for him to change up Berkshire's holdings with more growth-oriented businesses .

" Traders facing a conundrum: Bonds may offer more attractive returns in coming years . Equity risk premium is hovering around its lowest point since 2002, data from Bloomberg Intelligence showed . That suggests stocks are more expensive relative to bonds than they have been for most of the last two decades .  The S&P 500 has averaged a 12-month return of only 2.5% over the past three decades . That compares to an average annual return of 8.5%. The risk premium has stood around current levels .  The S&P 500 hasn’t seen a move exceeding 0.6% in either direction for 10 of the last 11 sessions . That's the longest such stretch since early December . Treasury yields stand near their highest levels in decades .  Not all periods with a negative or low equity risk premium have coincided with poor stock returns . The measure was negative for two long stretches in the post-World War II era, from October 1968 to October 1973, and from September 1980 to June 2002 .

" The stocks listed here have significant opportunities with AI . Their strong fundamentals also make them among the safer options for growth investors to consider . If you're a risk-averse investor or simply want exposure to AI without having to worry about your portfolio .  Nvidia looks to be an unshakable company, trading at an estimated 33 times its expected future earnings . The biggest risk facing the business today is a slowdown in AI spending . But I still see it as being a solidgrowth stock to hang on to for both the short and long terms .  An even safer stock than Nvidia may be Microsoft . It doesn't make chips, but it's less dependent on just the AI market than Nvidia . Microsoft has been a big name in tech for decades, and is looking to cash in on this new growth opportunity .  Amazon is investing heavily into AI data centers, chatbots, and robotaxis via its Zoox subsidiary . Amazon Web Services, which drives the bulk of the company's operating profit, should benefit significantly from more AI-powered growth as more businesses store data in the cloud .  Amazon's business is incredibly strong, and with its operations potentially getting even more diversified in the future, this is one of the safest AI stocks to own .

" Nvidia's data center chips are the best in the world for processing artificial intelligence workloads . New AI reasoning models require significantly more computing capacity than their predecessors . Nvidia stock is trading at an attractive valuation right now, which could set the stage for a rally to $200 before 2025 .  Nvidia is gearing up for the strongest year in its history thanks to its latest GPU architecture . Data center spending will reach $1 trillion per year by 2028 as companies race to meet that demand . Nvidia stock is trading at around $142 as of this writing (June 10), but here's why I think it's on the way to $200 before year-end .  Previous LLMs were great at generating one-shot responses that created a fast and convenient user experience . But reasoning models refine their responses in the background before delivering them to the user . It's possible Blackwell's 40-fold performance leap over Hopper still isn't enough for some reasoning models . Nvidia will start shipping a lineup of GPUs based on its new Rubin architecture in 2026, which could be 3.3 times faster .  Huang thinks annual data center spending is heading toward $1 trillion in 2028 . Nvidia generated $3.19 in earnings per share (EPS) over the last four quarters, which places its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 46.9 . That is comfortably below its 10-year average of 59.9, suggesting the stock might be undervalued right now .  Nvidia stock would have to climb by 38% over the next nine months to maintain its current P/E ratio of 46 . That would place Nvidia stock somewhere between $196 and $254 in the early stages of 2026 . However, the stock market is a forward-looking machine, so investors usually start pricing in future earnings ahead of time .

" One of Wall Street's top billionaire asset managers is increasing his position in artificial intelligence (AI) titan Nvidia . A laundry list of billionaire investors have been paring down or completely exiting their stakes in Nvidia for two years . PwC pegged its worldwide impact on gross domestic product by 2030 at $15.7 trillion .  Nvidia's market cap has skyrocketed by more than $3 trillion in less than two years . Tiger Global Management's billionaire chief Chase Coleman has been the exception to selling Nvidia stock .  The rise of artificial intelligence certainly fits the mold of a game-changing trend that would interest Tiger Global's billionaire investor . Chase Coleman choosing to expand his fund's exposure to Nvidia likely has to do with one or more of the following four factors . Nvidia's share of the graphics processing unit (GPU) market in high-compute data centers can be described as monopoly like .  AI-GPU scarcity has been working in Nvidia's favor . CEO Jensen Huang is overseeing the debut of a new advanced AI chip on an annual basis . Nvidia looks to be in no danger of ceding its clear-cut compute advantages .  Since Nvidia stock kicked off its historic run-up, most billionaires have pared down their exposure to the AI colossus or completely exited their respective positions . Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office sold all 9,500,750 shares of Nvidia stock between June 30, 2023 and Sept. 30, 2024 . David Tepper of Appaloosa shed 97% of his fund's stake (9.95 million shares sold) in Nvidia .  This persistent selling activity may be explained by nothing more than simple profit-taking . But there may be more to this consistent selling than just a desire to take profits . Most members of the ""Magnificent Seven"" are internally developing AI chips to use in their data centers .  Jensen Huang's accelerated innovation timeline may hurt, not, helping, his company . Wagering on Nvidia's largest customers to upgrade hardware on an annual or near-annual basis is risky and may not pay off .

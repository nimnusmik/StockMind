" SoundHound AI became a so-called meme stock last fall, as social media channels attempted to engineer a lucrative short squeeze . The company’s stock price surged on Nvidia's investment news in early 2024, but later reversed as the hype faded . The stock is still well below its late-2024 peak, and more of a ""hold"" than a ""buy"" right now .  The company changed its name to SoundHound AI and went public in the spring of 2022, by way of a special purpose acquisition company merger . The generative AI boom started seven months after OpenAI released ChatGPT 3.5 in late November 2022, kick-starting a game-changing economic boom . The company's stock price quadrupled in four short weeks as investors expected Nvidia to either buy the company or announce a purchase .  SoundHound AI was popular enough to gain traction on social media channels with market-moving powers . One group hoped to create a short squeeze, forcing bearish investors to cover their short positions on the stock . The short-sale interest stands at 32%, making it one of the most shorted stocks on the market today .  SoundHound AI's stock price has doubled in 52 weeks, but it's also down 62% from the peak of late December 2024 . Trailing sales are up to $102 million nowadays, compared to $51 million a year ago . However, the company posted negative free cash flows of $107 million over the last four quarters .  The $6 share price target may be too strict, but the current price of nearly $10 per share is still a bit much . It's an exciting growth story, even if most of the money-making results aren't showing up in financial statements yet . For now, I'm happy to just hold on to the SoundHound AI shares I already own .  Stock Advisor’s total average return is999% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to174% for the S&P 500 .

" Nvidia is the king of AI accelerator chips, but some smaller AI players may have more upside . AMD has a big opportunity as the AI inference market grows . Broadcom has big opportunities in networking, custom AI chips, and virtualization .  Nvidia remains one of the best-positioned companies to continue to benefit from the ongoing AI boom . The company is now massive, and as the base used to measure its growth gets bigger, the percentage gains are likely to get smaller . AMD has carved out a niche in AI inference, which is expected to become the much larger market over time .  AMD says one of the largest AI model companies is now using its GPUs to handle a significant share of its daily inference traffic . Major cloud computing providers are also turning to AMD's GPUs to power search, recommendations, and generative AI tasks .  AMD has become a leader in the market for data center central processing units (CPUs) AMD should continue to see solid overall data center CPU growth as AI infrastructure spending continues to increase . Broadcom is both a hardware and software AI growth story .  AI networking revenue jumped 170% last quarter and now makes up 40% of its AI revenue . The bigger prize is in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) These custom chips are designed for specific use cases, offering their buyers better performance and lower power usage .  Broadcom is well-positioned to achieve strong AI-related revenue growth in the coming years . While production of Alphabet's ASICs is fully ramped up, other large customers are just getting started . Broadcom has been transforming its product offerings and shifting it to a subscription sales model .  AMD is building momentum in AI inference and remains a leader in data center CPUs . Broadcom is powering AI infrastructure through its combination of networking hardware, custom chips, and enterprise virtualization software .

" Nvidia has an extremely high percentage of the market for artificial intelligence chips . It continues to report very high growth and strong profits .

Tech companies are racing to develop the most competitive AI platform or integrate some aspect of AI into their user interfaces . Companies now offer AI-generated content, images, summaries, and more .  As LLMs become more stable and effective, they're now going past inference to reasoning . Nvidia is planning on launching new technology, called Rubin, in 2026 .  Nvidia has the best and most powerful chips, and it has the lead in this market by a wide margin . Estimates put it somewhere between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market . Data center revenue outpaced total revenue in the first quarter, up 73% from last year .  Nvidia would have to report a compound annual growth rate of 15% to double over five years . That seems very doable, considering its current performance and future opportunities . Even if it can't sustain such a high price-to-sales ratio, it can probably achieve higher than 15% growth over the next five years, which means it can double even at a lower ratio .

" Artificial intelligence (AI) is an estimated $15.7 trillion global addressable market by 2030 . The capacity for AI-empowered software and systems to make split-second decisions without the aid of humans is a technology that can provide operating efficiencies throughout most industries .  No company has more directly benefited from the rise of artificial intelligence than Nvidia . It took less than two years for Nvidia's market cap to catapult by more than $3 trillion . Nvidia stock coming back to Earth, coupled with steady growth from other magnificent businesses, can lead to three non-tech stocks blowing past Wall Street's AI darling in the market cap column .  Every next-big-thing technology and innovation for more than 30 years has endured a bubble-bursting event early in its expansion . Investors have been overestimating the adoption rate and utility of game-changing trends for decades . Nvidia's hardware is commanding a 100%-plus premium to rival chips .  If history rhymes once more, and an AI bubble were to form and burst, Nvidia would almost certainly be one of the biggest losers . The following three non-tech titans all have the tools and intangibles needed to leapfrog Nvidia's valuation over the next 10 years .  Warren Buffett has packed his company's $280 billion investment portfolio and owned assets with businesses that can take advantage of nonlinear periods of growth . Berkshire stock has delivered an annualized return of almost 20% spanning 60 years . Berkshire appears to be on track to collect more than $5 billion in dividend income this year alone .  Visa's current market cap of $715 billion places it more than $2.7 trillion behind Nvidia's . Visa's core catalysts are the disproportionate nature of economic cycles . With periods of growth lasting longer than downturns, Visa is able to benefit from consumers and businesses increasing their spending over time .  Visa bounces back from downturns quicker than most financial stocks . Arguably the biggest opportunity for Visa exists beyond domestic borders . Cross-border payment volume has been consistently growing by a double-digit percentage annually . Visa's U.S. cash flow is rock-solid and predictable .  Walmart's $765 billion market cap leaves it about $2.7 trillion away from Nvidia as well . Its steady operating cash flow and deep pockets allow it to purchase products in bulk . Management has been aggressively investing in its online presence and ramping up its membership platform .  Walmart provides basic need goods, such as food, toiletries, and household cleaning products . Accepting lower margins on select groceries gets consumers in its stores or locked within its ecosystem where they can make discretionary purchases . Walmart is fully capable of generating predictable cash flow year after year .  The Motley Fool’s total average return is999% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to174% for the S&P 500 .

" The two tech giants have taken minority stakes in Skild AI, a startup building software to power autonomous robots . The deal is part of a Series B round led by SoftBank, which is anchoring the raise with a $100 million commitment that pegs Skild's valuation at around $4.5 billion .  Insiders say the Korean giant doesn't rate all of Skild's solutions as best-in-class, but it still wants access to the startup's team and roadmap . Samsung, on the other hand, appears to be taking a more cautious view .  The world might be robotics' next platform, and no one wants to be left behind .

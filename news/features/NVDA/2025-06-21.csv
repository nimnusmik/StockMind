" U.S. companies remain largely in the dark on when they’ll receive crucial magnets from China . President Donald Trump declared a “done” trade deal with Beijing 10 days ago . Many American firms that need Chinese minerals are still waiting on Beijing’s approval for shipments .  Some firms wait for magnets and others face restrictions selling to China . That friction risks derailing a fragile tariff truce clinched by Washington and Beijing last month .  Trump last month restricted US firms from exporting chip software, jet engines and a key ingredient to make plastic to China . Companies subject to Washington’s curbs have halted billions of dollars in planned shipments as they wait for players in unrelated sectors to secure permits from Beijing .  Energy and chemical giant INEOS Group Holdings SA has one tanker full of ethane waiting to go, while Enterprise Products Partners has three to four cargo ships stuck in limbo . China has adequate ethane supplies in reserve and can switch to using naphtha from the Middle East and other regions for much of their production .  Access to rare earths is an issue “that is going to continue to metastasize until there is resolution” China only agreed to grant licenses — if at all — for six months, before companies need to reapply for approvals . Firms doing business in the US and China could see recurring interruptions .  The terms of the deal were never publicized in writing by either side . Beijing still hasn't officially spelled out the deal’s requirements, nor has Xi publicly signaled his endorsement of it . Complicating the issue, companies often buy magnets from third-party suppliers, which serve defense and auto firms .  China’s Commerce Ministry is working to facilitate more approvals even as it asks for reams of information on how the materials will be used, people say . Some companies have been asked to supply data including detailed product designs, one of the people said . Chinese officials have expedited shipments for some major US and European automakers since Trump announced the agreement .  Trump’s agreement “will allow for rare earths to flow out of the country for a short period of time,” Hammer said . “Nobody trusts that this thaw is going to last.” Ford Motor Co. says rare-earths licenses have already forced the company to temporarily shutter one plant .  The automaker has an exclusive deal to get the products from MP Materials Corp. in Texas, with production starting later in the year . It has another deal with eVAC of Germany to get magnets from a South Carolina plant starting in 2026 . Scout Motors CEO Scott Keogh said his company is re-engineering brakes and drive units to reduce the need for rare earths . Scout is building a plant in South Carolina to make fully electric and hybrid SUVs as well as trucks .  Restrictions on sales to China of electronic design automation software for chipmaking are emblematic of the standoff . Those tools are used to design everything, from the highest-end processors for the likes of Nvidia Corp. and Apple . Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the measures were used to ‘annoy’ China into complying with a deal US negotiators thought they’d already reached .  There’s worry that heightened geopolitical risks will push Chinese customers to hunt for other suppliers or further develop domestic capabilities . “The risk is there for the London deal to fall apart,” said chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis .",negative,"tariff, china, suppliers, shipments, beijing"

Don’t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you joinStock Advisor .  Home sales last month dropped to their slowest march pace since 2009 . Matt Argersinger: ""Remember from a moment where we were in 2009. That's right. In the midst of a global financial crisis caused in part by a housing crash"" Ricky Mulvey: ""I'm definitely buying the CNBC version of this story.""  Some sellers who have been waiting for mortgage rates to fall have decided that they can't keep waiting . This is one data point, but is this an inflecting point? What are you seeing here? Matt Argersinger:  Ricky Mulvey: We still have millions of homeowners locked into long term fixed mortgage rates under 5%, under 4%, in many cases, under 3% . Ricky: ""I feel like, yes, we've got this rise in inventory data for March, but I don't think it's Dick's. sadly, the data could actually inflect downward Ricky .  D. R. Horton, the country's largest home builder, recently reported they're telling a very different story . Argersinger: There's a lot of questions for these Home Builders, specifically around tariffs . A lot of the people involved in new home construction are immigrants .  Home Builders have kept building throughout this whole period and have kept selling homes . But when I see the new home sales data, what I think it tells me is more about the demand side of the equation, which we know to be strong . We've got the biggest generation of first time home buyers in history .  Ricky Mulvey: New home sales are probably going to be heading in the wrong direction for the time being . Ricky: Mortgage rates are expensive, financing is hard to get. To get deals done, you have to do discounts which hurts your sales. At the same time, you mentioned you got higher labor costs, you've got higher input costs. You now have a lot of uncertainty about the economy and what these tariffs are going to do to your business. You're putting less shovels into the ground.  Matt Argersinger: Big story is the comp sales decline, comparable sales for Chipotle dropping about half a percent . This is the first drop since COVID and also coming off a heater, a five ish percent rise from last quarter . CEO Scott Boatwright, very quick to mention that this could be a weather problem and a macro problem .  Management said they expect things to improve by the second half . But you have to remember what they did last year . Look at COMMS Q2 of last year up 11.2%. That just shows you how tough the comparisons are going to get this year .  Ricky Mulvey: If you're a Chipotle shareholder, you have to anticipate that growth this year is going to be a lot slower than it was last year . A lot of the growth is really just going to come on the revenue side, Mulvey says . Mulvey hopes to start seeing management credit the weather when things are going well for them .  Matt Argersinger: Even with this decline in comparable sales, these are incredibly profitable businesses . Sales still growing six percent to about three billion dollars and they're still opening new restaurants, he says .  Ricky Mulvey: There's a Wall Street Journal column earlier this month that had the unfortunate title of your new lunch habit is hurting the economy . Mulvey says the number of lunches bought outside the home were lower in 2024 than in 2020, in the height of the pandemic . He says there's a version where Chipotle wins in this environment, where people are tightening their belts .  There's some headwinds here, but this is still really affordable compared to a lot of their competitors, Matt Argersinger says . Ricky Mulvey: If I go to Chipotle, I can get a steak bowl for about $11.50.  Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on more cash than any company ever in history . Ricky Mulvey: We're seeing a similar thing in Denver and what I've noticed is sometimes the mains are still all right .  Matt Argersinger: Is Warren Buffett battening down the hatches to buy up a bunch of stuff if the market turns south? Are you taking this cash pile as a macro signal? No. I think he's always invested with a long term mindset .  Buffett is the ultimate optimist when it comes to the future of the US economy . If Buffett saw a compelling investment or acquisition opportunity, he'd make it probably regardless of what Abel or anyone thinks . Ricky says this is actually macro sickling .  Buffett's favorite market valuation tool is the market cap GDP ratio . It's the total market capitalization of a country stock, US, relative to its gross domestic product . He said in the past, when that ratio is above 100%, the market is overvalued when it's below 100% .  The evidence is undeniable that Buffett thinks or thought that valuations were expensive, and he was preparing Berkshire Hathaway for just that . Matt Argersinger: I think he does see a lot of clouds on the horizon . Ricky Mulvey: There's probably storms ahead, not just for US stocks, but I think for the US economy .  US government changed its export rules for certain chips last week, particularly those that are going to China . This was a big news for Nvidia which warned of a $5.5 billion write-off as a result of that rule change . AMD was hit by those changes too.

AMD's MI308 chips are pared down versions of AMD's latest GPU series accelerators that go in data centers . They're purpose made for this market and 2025 was supposed to be the launch year for these chips . They have been in prototype and the R&D phase .  AMD and Nvidia are getting shut out of a market even on the lower end . The companies have been working around export controls for some time. They already understand they can't sell their most capable accelerators into China .  Asit Sharma: Are they designed but not yet built? Were they built, and there's already orders for them? Is there a stockpile of these designed manufactured chips that AMD thought it was going to be able to deliver to China that now is just going to sit there?

Son envisions a version of Shenzhen that would bring back high-tech manufacturing to the US . The park may comprise production lines for AI-powered industrial robots, people say .  Project Crystal Land is SoftBank's most ambitious attempt in a career that’s spanned numerous bet-the-house bids, thousands-fold-returns and billions of dollars in losses . It's not clear what part Son sees for TSMC, which already plans to invest $165 billion in the US .  The project has been floated to executives at South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. of Commerce Howard Lutnick . Son has pulled together a list of SoftBank Vision Fund portfolio companies that might take part in the project .  SoftBank-backed startups working on robotics and automation technologies may set up production facilities at the industrial complex . SoftBank is exploring the Arizona project as it also moves forward on plans to invest as much as $30 billion into OpenAI and plans to buy Ampere Computing LLC .  SoftBank’s cash stood at ¥3.4 trillion ($23 billion) at the end of March . The Tokyo-based company has since tapped its T-Mobile US Inc. stake, selling roughly a quarter of what it held in March to raise $4.8 billion this month . SoftBank also has net assets valued at ¥25.7 trillion, of which chip designer Arm Holdings Plc makes the single largest portion .  Masayoshi Son’s ambition to set up a trillion-dollar industrial complex in Arizona could signal additional, aggressive investments . SoftBank might need to monetize mature assets, as it did in a recent $4.8 billion sale of a stake in T-Mobile .  Musk is a ""long-term thinker, and he takes risks,"" analyst says .

" There seems at least a solid probability that Nvidia stock still has not just good or great but amazing growth potential left . Year-over-year earnings growth solidly in the double-digit percentages and a reasonable stock valuation should be all that's needed to keep Nvidia investors very happy . Think of it as ""Nvidia the superstar stock 2.0""  Nvidia has a market cap of $3.55 trillion, as of June 18, making it the world's second most valuable publicly traded company . Nvidia management expects the company to generate revenue of $45 billion in its fiscal second quarter, which equates to an annual revenue run rate of $180 billion .  Nvidia stock is trading at 25.4 times Wall Street's projected forward earnings per share, or EPS, as of June 18 . That's an attractive valuation for a company that analysts expect to grow EPS at an average annual rate of 30% over the next five years . The main reason I think the valuation will likely remain relatively reasonable (at least much of the time) for a while .  Nvidia stock's valuation is reasonable in part because Wall Street analysts are going to tend to be too conservative in their estimates, in my view . Some investors will probably feel that Wall Street is being too liberal in its estimates because they themselves feel cautious given Nvidia's humongous size .  Nvidia's GPUs will be the ""brains"" inside many of the autonomous vehicles . The company will stay ahead of the innovation pack by entering emerging new technologies via organic growth and acquisitions . An example here is quantum computing, in which Nvidia will be increasingly involved .

" Nvidia has a small portfolio of companies in which it invests . Most of the company's investments are part of the broader artificial intelligence ecosystem or partner with the AI chip giant . Recently, Nvidia piled into a stock that's already doubled from its initial public offering .  CoreWeave operates data centers specifically set up to run artificial intelligence applications .

" AMD probably won't beat Nvidia in the AI processor market, but investors should look at the bigger picture . PTC's long-term growth prospects remain undiminished by near-term pressure .  Two Motley Fool contributors think these discounted stocks have what it takes to deliver big wins for your portfolio . Keith Noonan: I think AMD will still be able to score wins in AI and reward patient shareholders . The company's share price is down 46% from its all-time high .  AMD posted a gross margin of 50% in its Q1 earnings report, up from 47% in last year's quarter . AMD doesn't necessarily need to unseat Nvidia at the bleeding edge of AI processors in order to deliver strong returns for investors . The AI processor market will likely continue to grow at a rapid pace .  Even if AMD continues to be second-fiddle in the AI processor market, this creates a path for its stock to deliver market-crushing returns for shareholders . LeeSamaha: Industrial software company PTC's stock price is down 8% in 2025 and 16% from its all-time high .  The uncertainty in the economy due to the tariff conflict is causing PTC's customers to lengthen sales cycles and downsize deals . Management lowered its constant currency ARR growth guidance for 2025 from 9% to 10% to a new range of 7% to 9% .  Advanced Micro Devices is 22 times FCF in 2025 .

The new robots have already enabled Serve to expand into Miami and Dallas, with Atlanta to follow during the current quarter . The company is aiming to charge $1 per delivery across the board in all markets .  Serve's first-quarter revenue was actually a 150% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2024 three months earlier . Wall Street's consensus estimate suggests the company could generate $6.8 million in revenue for the whole of 2025 . It lost $13.2 million on the bottom line during the first quarter, which puts the company on track to exceed its record annual loss .  Serve's trailing-12-month revenue of $1.3 million and its market capitalization of $599 million, its stock trades at an eye-popping price-to-sales ratio of 460 . That means it's a staggering 18 times more expensive than Nvidia stock, which trades at a P/S ratio of 26 .  Serve's valuation does look more reasonable if you measure it based on its future revenue, using Wall Street's forecasts .

" The quarterly filing of Form 13Fs offers a way for everyday investors to track the buying and selling activity of Wall Street's leading money managers . The deadline for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) was May 15 .  Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management, who's overseeing $22.7 billion in AUM, has a rich track record of outperformance . Coatue's position in Nvidia peaked at 49,802,020 shares in the March-ended quarter of 2023 . The company continued to be a seller of the world's leading artificial intelligence stock,Nvidia .  During the first quarter of 2025, Laffont's fund dumped 1,460,653 shares of Nvidia stock . Over the last eight quarters, Coatue's billionaire boss has overseen the sale of 41,256,185 cumulative shares .  Despite Nvidia having superior hardware, competitive pressures are beginning to weigh on its margins . Many of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are internally developing chips they'll use in their own data centers . The presence of external and internal competition is also working to minimize the effect of AI-GPU scarcity .  There hasn't been a game-changing innovation in more than three decades that's avoided a bubble-bursting event early in its expansion . The fact that most businesses haven't optimized their AI solutions, and in many instances aren't generating a positive return on their AI investments, strongly signals that investors have (again) overestimated the early innings utility and adoption rate of a next-big-thing trend .  CoreWeave has purchased 250,000 Hopper chips from Nvidia, which is no small investment . In return, the company can lease out its AI infrastructure and services to clients . Coatue's billionaire money manager Laffont scooped up 14,402,999 shares in the first quarter .  CoreWeave's sales are projected to catapult from a reported $1.92 billion in 2024 to an estimated $19.66 billion come 2028 . The company also announced a strategic deal with OpenAI that tacks on $11.2 billion in its revenue backlog .

" In this podcast, Motley Fool analyst Asit Sharma joins host Mary Long to discuss the complex problems that quantum computers could solve . In the show, Sharma discusses the healthcare and logistics companies benefit from ultra-fast processing .  The Motley Fool senior analyst Asit Sharma and Mary Long discuss quantum computing . They discuss the potential of quantum computing, what investors need to know about this technology . Quantum's future may come sooner than you think, they say .  Asit Sharma, a resident quantum industry expert, joins us to talk about quantum computing . Sharma: The promise of quantum computing is to solve intensely complex, large scale problems with a lot of variables .  While it sounds like it's all powerful, quantum computing isn't going to be applied to simple problems to solve them faster . Think really difficult things like predicting the weather . Classical computers have a lot of trouble with solving things linearly one step at a time .  Everything running through a computer, including AI computation is based on this very discrete binary system of zeros and ones added together . Quantum computing is a little different in that it takes a concept from quantum mechanics, which is one of the mysteries that underlines our physical existence .  If a particle can exist as one discrete thing, but also a wave function at the same time, it means that we can trap that particle and have it sit in a state of what's called superposition . A state of superposition means that that particle will encompass all the possibilities or probabilities of being a zero or a one . Quantum computing is a way to look at something that could be any number of possibilities, and the idea of a quantum computer is to direct the way that wave function collapses .  Asit Sharma: Generative AI is very suited to looking for patterns in sequential pieces of data . But you can only do so much with that. sort of show us the results we want that will be more probabilistically aligned with what we want to see .  Classical computing can only do so much when you're trying to figure out this one problem . But a quantum computer could really scale up and look at all the possibilities . We can get a better understanding of this binding from molecule to protein .  Asit Sharma: There are different industries that can benefit from quantum computing technology . One, surprisingly, is surprisingly, the delivery of goods, he says . Sharma: When you think about practical goods that could come from such technology, what are those goods?  Quantum computing may be very good at in the future is quickly solving some of this stuff . The idea of trying to understand risk across many, many companies or even within a single company .  Asit Sharma: We have some fledgling quantum computers that have been built and are functional . They are mostly being used by research institutions, but we're starting to see Fortune 500 companies utilize these computers in very basic types of experimental computations .  A lot of energy is going into solving for the errors in quantum computations . We have to keep those in a state that remains in superposition, meaning that it's got that state of lots of probabilities if we're trapping one ion and asking it to do it to solve the problems .  We don't want it to interact with the environment. perform computations. That can make that function collapse more quickly, and we won't get the desired results . Right now things are still at an experimental state, but we have reached a stage where companies are solving some smaller real world problems .  Asit Sharma: There's a lot to unpack with what Jensen Wong said, Mary. We're using less energy to actually make these computers operate. Decoherence? Is the usefulness of these quantum computers that Jensen's predicting? Is it that they're more useful because they can solve more difficult problems?  Jensen Huang said he didn't realize there were publicly traded companies that were building quantum computers . He invited some of the CEOs of the companies that have built quantum computers onto the stage to explain to the audience why he was wrong to say that . But he's right in that the timescale is not going to be 2026 .  quantum computer is going to be able to perform a task better than the best alternative we have that exists in a classical computer for a useful problem . When that occurs, many people will say we've reached a point where we have an inflection or a tipping point, maybe like a ChatGPT moment .  The primary computational unit in quantum computing is called a qubit . This is where you are using one particle and you are performing operations on that particle to get that probabilistic result . We have to be able to have qubits scale up. Many qubits, which are already prone to errors, are able to solve problems and then communicate with each other .  Entanglement is cool, but we can use entanglement to do computation . We can influence through certain quantum algorithms . When we take one qubit and then add another and add another, we can scale that system up . We're going to see a lot of, I'm going to call them quantum bros in advance, talking about where you should be investing .  IBM, Microsoft, and Google are building their own quantum computers from the ground up . Asit Sharma: These companies are building out all the supporting technology that powers these systems .  Alphabet has a chip called Willow that reduces error rates . IBM has a processor called the Heron quantum processor . Microsoft got fascinated with a type of approach, which is very theoretical .  Microsoft had to prove existence of what had been a theoretical particle called the Moderna Fermion . But in doing so, their approach is more fault-tolerant than the other approaches . The coded information is very stable and so it's taking an approach which is based on design .  Asit Sharma: I admire Microsoft for its ambition and the investments of however 100 millions they made . Mary Long: Apart from those three big dogs that you just walked us through, is anybody else currently working on building out a full-stack quantum computer?  Quantinuum is actually a joint venture between a company, it's very small company out of the UK, which merged up in this joint venture with the giantHoneywell computing . The company also has really a host platform, as IBM does .  Amazon is taking a totally different approach than the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet, and IBM . Rather than building out this full-stack computer, they're providing quantum computing access through its Cloud platform . It's like AWS, but for quantum computing, Asit Sharma says .  Amazon is using its might and its Cloud platform to further the quantum computing industry along, says Mary Kay . Kay: If one of these smaller companies really takes off? Well, they're already on Amazon's platform, and that will help Amazon scale up its quantum business . That's the advantage, Kay says, but the disadvantage is that Amazon doesn't have to make its own quantum computers .  Amazon is hosting the actual cryogenic systems for some of these other companies . It's getting a first-hand view of what it takes to build these computers to operate them . Amazon is also developing some interesting add-ons to its ecosystem .  Amazon's Brackett system is one of seven companies that are working on quantum computing . IonQand Righetti Computing are both companies that develop quantum systems that can link up to the Cloud .  D-Wave quantum has its approach this annealing, it fits right into Baquet. Ion Q, as I mentioned before, trapping ions, it goes right up into Amazon Baquete. Rigetti computing, also has a more modular approach.  Asit Sharma: The chipmakers right now are mostly looking at how their applications will be able to accelerate the development of quantum computing . Mary Long: What about chipmakers and chip designers? How do they fit into this future quantum landscape?  Synopsis is acquiring a company called ANSIS, which specializes in physics simulations . The chip designers, the electronic design automation companies, I think, have a role to play in quantum computing . The next step is looking at how you can transmit information from one quantum system to another .  There's a lot of interesting work that's happening among the smaller players in the quantum industry and in the biotech space, but it's highly technical . A lot of those small upstarts aren't profitable, so it's hard to make a good judgment about their financial situation . In the healthcare industry, rather than investing in biotech, if that feels a little bit too crazy to touch, what you can do is go to the big dogs .  Asit Sharma: The downside is that some of these smaller players may scale more quickly than would think at a first glance . The benefit in my mind, of applying this biotech approach to the quantum industry and investing in it, that feels obvious .  Quantum computing is going to open up a Pandora's box in encryption standards, says Dr. Andrew Keen . Keen: Quantum computing will open up Pandora's Box in all of our encryption standards .  A company that's very small like Ion Q which is thinking of building these large quantum networks over distances in addition to its own computer, has potentially a solution for a secure network that a bank could use . There is some possibility that a few of these companies, just like the little biotechs that you alluded to, could blow up . Could there be binary outcomes where you put your money in and it's either boom or bust? Sure .  Jensen Wong had an idea that 15-30 years in the future, this thing could be big . It's fun if you could identify a company and you're able to hold it for 20 years . It might not hurt to buy some shares in a few forward-looking companies that are embracing quantum .  Asit Sharma: Quantum computing is at least five years away, but he thinks it'll come sooner than that 15-30 year initial time frame . Sharma: Companies that are embracing it will be customers of the big dogs, maybe one or two big dogs .  Asit Sharmahas positions in Advanced Micro Devices, Amazon, D-Wave Quantum, IonQ, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Synopsys . Mary Longhas no position in any of the stocks mentioned .

" Nvidia is likely to crush Wall Street's expectations thanks to robust demand for its AI chips . The healthy state of AI hardware spending should be a tailwind for Nvidia's guidance . Shares of the chip designer have shot up by 28% in the past month .  Nvidia's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 calls for $43 billion in revenue at the midpoint of its guidance range . That would translate into a year-over-year increase of 65% . However, there is a good chance that Nvidia may be able to coast past that expectation thanks to demand for its AI graphics processing units .  The orders for this chip have reportedly surged following the increase in demand for cost-efficient AI models in the wake of DeepSeek's breakthrough .

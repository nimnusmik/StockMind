Netflix was an early name in my portfolio, inspired by fellow Fool Rick Munarriz's in-depth analysis of the company in the mid-2000s .

My oldest Amazon investment is only up by 430% since January 2017 . I wish I had pounced on Amazon much earlier, like Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner did . Amazon is not a one-trick pony, but the company should pick up a few more skills .  The early leader in AI accelerator hardware could very well run into a superior alternative in the next few years .

Global investment in AI infrastructure is expected to hit a humongous $7 trillion by 2030, according to a forecast by McKinsey . Nearly three-fourths of that will be directed toward data centers . Huang believes sovereign AI is set to become the next big growth driver for Nvidia .  Its revenue from the gaming and AI PC segment shot up 48% from the year-ago period to a record $3.8 billion . The year-over-year growth of its automotive and robotics revenue nearly matched that of its data center business . Both these segments can keep growing at elevated levels over the next five years thanks to AI .

Nvidia seems well equipped to sustain solid growth rates over the next five years on account of its dominant presence in these multibillion-dollar markets .

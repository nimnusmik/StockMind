It has products sprawling from mainframe software to cybersecurity to virtual desktops . I could easily see it rising to a $2 trillion company within three years .  Broadcom's AI offerings are split into two categories: connectivity switches and custom AI accelerators, which it calls XPUs . Data centers need devices to stitch together the multi-piece answer, and they will become more important as we transition into the next phase of AI .  Broadcom's custom AI accelerators are an alternative to GPUs, as they can process multiple calculations in parallel . The difference between an XPU and a GPU is that XPUs are designed for a specific workload and don't have the flexibility of a GPU . The AI hyperscalers have a love-hate relationship with Nvidia, as Nvidia makes top-notch products but charges an incredibly high premium .  In fiscal year 2024, Broadcom's total revenue was $51.6 billion . Of that, only $12.2 billion was AI-related revenue . Broadcom expects its AI semiconductor revenue to reach $60 billion to $90 billion by FY 2027 .  Broadcom's trailing-12-month revenue total is $57 billion . With revenue likely more than doubling from now until 2027, I'm fairly confident that the stock will at least double .

" Shares of Nvidia fell below $100 earlier this year due to trade concerns . Now, however, the market is at around all-time highs, and so is Nvidia's stock . The company's cutting-edge artificial intelligence chips are crucial for many tech businesses deploying next-gen technologies .  Nvidia's market cap may be around $3.5 trillion, but it trades at a modest forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 33 (based on analyst estimates) The average stock on theS&P 500 trades at 22.9 times its future earnings .  Nvidia still faces considerable uncertainty about trade restrictions involving one of its key markets, China . The problem with Nvidia's valuation is it may look cheap, but only if its growth rate remains high . Any hint of a pullback could send the stock back to less than $100 .  Nvidia's sales were up by an incredible 69% in its most recent quarter, which ended on April 27 . If that growth rate were to fall below 30%, investors would be nearly as bullish about the stock as they are now . But based on Nvidia's high valuation, a best-case scenario still looks to be priced in .  You may still be better off simply buying Nvidia stock sooner rather than later .

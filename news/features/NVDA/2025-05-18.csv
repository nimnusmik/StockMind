" Robots are the physical manifestation of AI, says Tejas Dessai, director of research at Global X ETFs . General-purpose humanoids that can do just about any task will arrive in a more distant future . For now, it’s about taking automated robots that are performing repetitive tasks and making them aware of their physical surroundings .  Over time, training these robots will get cheaper . As they become more sophisticated and affordable, it opens up a breadth of applications that can be deployed across industries . This makes the intersection of robotics and AI one of the most disruptive and innovative spaces in the technology and industrial sectors .  AI-robotics companies tend to fall more in the early-majority stage of adoption, while general-use humanoid robotics are in the innovators .

" Supermicro’s stock has dropped about 60% from its all-time high . The maker of artificial intelligence servers closed at a record split-adjusted high of $118.81 on March 13, 2024 . Today, Supermicro trades at about $47.81 .  Supermicro is still an underdog in traditional servers compared to market leaders like Hewlett Packard Enterpriseand Dell Technologies . But it carved out a niche with its dedicated AI servers, andRaymond Jamesestimates it now controls about 9% of that growing market . Its close relationship with Nvidia also gave it access to a steady supply of top-tier data center GPUs .  Over the past year, Supermicro's revenue growth continued to cool off as its gross margins shrank . Many of its customers postponed their new AI server purchases in anticipation of Nvidia's next-gen Blackwell chips . Supply chain constraints made it harder to fulfill its existing orders . The macro headwinds exacerbated that pressure by forcing companies to rein in their spending on pricey AI servers .  For the full year, Supermicro expects its revenue to rise 46% to 51% growth . Analysts expect Supermicro to grow as rapidly as it did over the past three years . Supermicro still faces a lot of macro and competitive challenges, but it also looks like a bargain at 18 times next year's earnings .

Meta has been a big investor in artificial intelligence for a long time . It'll just take some time for the company to fully realize the impact of AI on its business .  Meta used to require advertisers to select a target audience for their ad creatives . Generative AI has the potential to unlock a ton of value for Meta's business . As a result, there's more emphasis on the ad creative .  Meta stands to benefit from building several different types of AI agents . Mark Zuckerberg: ""Our goal is to make it so that any business can basically tell us what objective they're trying to achieve ... and then we just do the rest""  Meta could benefit from developing customer service agents and sales agents for its messaging apps . That could enable businesses to deepen their relationships with prospective and existing customers without spending significantly on overhead . Eventually, Meta could use AI to generate bespoke content for each user .  Meta could create an endless feed of hyper-specific personalized content .

" Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) AI can add up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy come 2030 . One of the linchpins of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's growth strategy is to debut an advanced graphics processing unit (GPU) every year .  PwC's estimate that AI will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030 . No company has been a bigger beneficiary of the AI revolution than Nvidia . The potential problem is that one of Nvidia's biggest perceived competitive advantages might also be its undoing .  Nvidia's outperformance is directly reflective of its ideal positioning in AI-accelerated data centers . With demand for AI-GPUs handily swamping supply, Wall Street's AI darling has been able to charge a veritable arm and a leg for its hardware .  Nvidia saw its GAAP gross margin explode to as high as 78.4% in the fiscal first quarter one year ago . CEO Jensen Huang's aggressive ambition is to bring a next-generation AI chip to market on an annual basis .  Huang wants to keep Nvidia in its decisive leadership position on the compute front . Huang's aggressive spending on research to develop faster and more efficient AI-GPUs is something that Wall Street and investors would almost universally cheer . But there's a very real possibility that Jensen Huang's accelerated innovation timeline may do more harm than good for his company .  Many of Nvidia's leading customers by net sales within the Mag-7 are internally developing AI-GPUs and solutions of their own . The hardware isn't going to externally compete against Hopper, Blackwell, or the company's successor chips, it'll be notably cheaper than Nvidia's .  Jensen Huang's aggressive innovation cycle is also potentially damaging to data-center leasing models . Businesses wanting cutting-edge compute capabilities might pass on CoreWeave's data centers faster than investors might realize . The value of these chips will likely depreciate rapidly .  The Motley Fool Stock Advisor's total average return is792% -- a market-crushing outperformance compared to173% for the S&P 500 . Consider when Netflixmade this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $669,517!  Jensen Huang's ambitious goals might make Nvidia its own worst enemy . The company has a long history of high-flying tech companies .

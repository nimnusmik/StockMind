" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with government and industry figures in Europe to pitch Nvidia as Europe’s prime partner in achieving AI sovereignty . The company is set to build an AI cloud platform with Deutsche Telekom, their new partnership with French company Mistral AI involving a data centre .  Huang's pitch of delivering sovereign AI to Europe resonated with European leaders . The idea that Europe’s critical digital infrastructure should not be dependent on US companies has existed for a long time . But these worries have taken on a renewed sense of urgency since US President Donald Trump's arrival in January .  AWS, Microsoft and Google supply around 70% of the European market . Schuchart: ""This is the wild west of AI, and right now you bet on the fastest horse, because there are hardly any other horses""  Nvidia is expanding at a time of deep geopolitical realignment and heightened protectionism . Huang has been a strong critic of US export bans in the semiconductor sector to China . Nvidia walked away from $15bn of sales in China due to export curbs .  There is increasingly a question about the origins of the data used to build AI models . What jurisdiction do governments have over their citizens' data if it is stored in another country?  Huang’s view that AI will become a utility is that it will be considered infrastructure just as electricity, infrastructure, and information connectivity . Running AI workloads across borders adds latency, risk, and regulatory complexity .  Having domestic digital infrastructure means that, in an emergency, the government could take over essential services . If AI becomes fully integrated in the UK’s NHS, it will become even more critical to have local infrastructure to support it .  Other US companies are also trying to address data sovereignty concerns by setting up different legal entities . Nvidia's chips are not only the most advanced, but they are also some of the most energy-intensive and expensive .  Chinese company DeepSeek claimed to have made a product extremely similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT for a tiny fraction of the cost . Nvidia lost 17% of its market value, representing the biggest market cap loss for a single stock ever ($589bn)  Anton Lokhmotov, founder and CEO of optimised AI solutions company KRAI, explains that, when trying to optimise how machines work, ""the software part of the story is often forgotten"" as companies would rather buy more hardware than invest in optimisation . ""It is very painful to realise how inefficient it is,"" he says .  AI sector's rapid growth is coming at massive environmental costs, such as through the continued use of non-renewable energy and exacerbating water scarcity . These are factors that contribute to a climate crisis that is already creating a more unstable global landscape . ""Right now, enterprises are chasing outcomes. around certain market conditions and price projections, optimisation is not a priority,"" says Kevin Dallas .  Huang and Nvidia face the same fate, but rather, it should serve as a reminder to European leaders that no one company, or person, has all the best answers amidst this time of AI revolution .",positive,"nvidia, china, microsoft, aws, europe"

The selling activity in Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Amazon might be nothing more than simple profit-taking .

The biggest worry is that Nvidia and Meta sport downside risk if an AI bubble were to form and burst .  Meta Platforms and Amazon's cloud infrastructure service platform (Amazon Web Services), advertising services, and subscription services, would fare just fine if AI investments slowed . Nvidia is tipping the scales at a trailing-12-month (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio above 26. That's more than double its peers and historically not a sustainable multiple .

" Tech giants are spending hundreds of billions of dollars in 2025 on AI infrastructure . Nvidia's CUDA software platform creates significant switching costs that effectively lock customers into its ecosystem . Despite trading at 50 times earnings, Nvidia's growth and enduring moat justify the premium valuation .  Just four companies plan to spend well over $300 billion in capital expenditures this year alone . That's more than the GDP of 140 countries . It's well over the inflation-adjusted $280 billion the U.S. government spent over 13 years to send Americans to the moon . Wall Street expects Nvidia's top line this year to come in just shy of $200 billion .  Nvidia's CUDA platform is a foundational layer that programmers build on top of . CUDA serves as a backbone on which most of today's AI architecture is built . Many higher-level AI tools and platforms are designed to run specifically on CUDA .  Nvidia's competitors are trying to unseat CUDA as the industry standard, but that's a difficult task . CUDA effectively ""locks in"" Nvidia's customers within its ecosystem and allows the company to command premium prices .

" Many investors shy away from “defensive” stocks like mobile providers because they don’t offer the potential for huge gains . But these are the very stocks that investors turn to during recessionsor market sell-offs precisely because of their stocks .  When big tech stocks are dropping 40%, 50% or even more, it can panic even the most steadfast of investors . To remain in the market, money often flows to stocks like Verizon and AT&T, which may drop only a little bit or perhaps even rise when momentum stocks are crashing . The reason these types of stocks tend to hold up during recessions is their services are always needed .

" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with government and industry figures in Europe to pitch Nvidia as Europe’s prime partner in achieving AI sovereignty . The company is set to build an AI cloud platform with Deutsche Telekom, their new partnership with French company Mistral AI involving a data centre .  Huang's pitch of delivering sovereign AI to Europe resonated with European leaders . The idea that Europe’s critical digital infrastructure should not be dependent on US companies has existed for a long time . But these worries have taken on a renewed sense of urgency since US President Donald Trump's arrival in January .  AWS, Microsoft and Google supply around 70% of the European market . Schuchart: ""This is the wild west of AI, and right now you bet on the fastest horse, because there are hardly any other horses""  Nvidia is expanding at a time of deep geopolitical realignment and heightened protectionism . Huang has been a strong critic of US export bans in the semiconductor sector to China . Nvidia walked away from $15bn of sales in China due to export curbs .  There is increasingly a question about the origins of the data used to build AI models . What jurisdiction do governments have over their citizens' data if it is stored in another country?  Huang’s view that AI will become a utility is that it will be considered infrastructure just as electricity, infrastructure, and information connectivity . Running AI workloads across borders adds latency, risk, and regulatory complexity .  Having domestic digital infrastructure means that, in an emergency, the government could take over essential services . If AI becomes fully integrated in the UK’s NHS, it will become even more critical to have local infrastructure to support it .  Other US companies are also trying to address data sovereignty concerns by setting up different legal entities . Nvidia's chips are not only the most advanced, but they are also some of the most energy-intensive and expensive .  Chinese company DeepSeek claimed to have made a product extremely similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT for a tiny fraction of the cost . Nvidia lost 17% of its market value, representing the biggest market cap loss for a single stock ever ($589bn)  Anton Lokhmotov, founder and CEO of optimised AI solutions company KRAI, explains that, when trying to optimise how machines work, ""the software part of the story is often forgotten"" as companies would rather buy more hardware than invest in optimisation . ""It is very painful to realise how inefficient it is,"" he says .  AI sector's rapid growth is coming at massive environmental costs, such as through the continued use of non-renewable energy and exacerbating water scarcity . These are factors that contribute to a climate crisis that is already creating a more unstable global landscape . ""Right now, enterprises are chasing outcomes. around certain market conditions and price projections, optimisation is not a priority,"" says Kevin Dallas .  Huang and Nvidia face the same fate, but rather, it should serve as a reminder to European leaders that no one company, or person, has all the best answers amidst this time of AI revolution .",positive,"nvidia, china, microsoft, aws, europe"

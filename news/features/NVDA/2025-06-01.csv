" The stock market's crazy first five months of 2025 have left Wall Street pros in a pickle .

Consumer discretionary shares that house some of the biggest retailers, homebuilders and automakers are among the worst performers this year .  In post-US presidential election years over the past seven decades, the S&P 500 has struggled in early June as investors booked profits heading into the summer . This is particularly true if the index gets a strong boost in May, like it did this year with a 6.2% jump .",negative,"markets, stocks, 2025, stock, market"

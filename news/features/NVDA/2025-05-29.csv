" In this podcast, Motley Fool co-founder and Chief Rule Breaker David Gardner joins host Ricky Mulvey for a conversation about how he thinks about valuation . They discuss Palantir's current valuation, and what investors should prepare for . The value of paying up for ""top dogs"" and holding on to them for long periods of time .  Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, available when you joinStock Advisor . Apple:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008,you’d have $37,070!* Netflix: If you invested in the company in 2004, you'd have $639,271!  Motley Fool co-founder and chief Rule Breaker David Gardner joined us for a conversation on today's show . Gardner: I've been thinking a lot about and not buying, maybe to my detriment, a company called Palantir . At the time of this writing, it's got a blistering valuation, about 95 times enterprise value to revenue .  David Gardner: Rule Breaker is focused not on all the stocks or the whole market . I focus on the innovator in each industry. That is trait number one of rule Breaker stocks and there are six traits .  You will never buy Palantir if you're trying to find a cheap, says Ricky Mulvey . That's true industry by industry, Ricky, for the rule breakers. who's the first mover, not just any industry . That, for me, is the way to maximize your returns as an investor .  David Gardner: Why are all the best companies always trading at premium valuations? Why wasIntuitive Surgicalwhen I first picked it in 2005, trading at something like 75 times earnings . Yet, it's gone up more than 100 times in value since then in the 20 succeeding years . Virtually every great company from Tesla to Netflix, the list goes on .  The performance of a company and the quality of its stock over time is directly correlated to its brand . Who the CEO is, what's the culture of the company? Can it innovate its way out of a box? What about its brand? None of those four is included anywhere in the financial statements .  Ricky Mulvey: What about their brand, the promise you make to your customers every day? This is an incredibly important point. It's one I try to make big in my rule Breaker Investing book that comes out this fall .  Some of the biggest winners in the full universe, some of which you mentioned, Amazon, Netflix, Mercado Libre, I use Y charts, which sometimes can mess some things up, especially for historic multiples . These often traded above ten times enterprise value to revenue, sometimes even 45 times if you look at an early Amazon . But, that's a comparative value town to where Palantir is today, which is a more mature company .  David Gardner: I think it's natural to recognize when companies are at all time high, not just for their stock, but for their valuation multiples . Gardner: When I buy a stock at a dead minimum, I'm holding it for at least three years. Preferably three decades. What ends up mattering is not the valuation multiple that you paid for 17 or seven years ago, which I can't even remember now. What matters far more.  The companies that are winning for everybody, not equally in all the time, but the companies that just keep winning, are winning . What really matters is the impact of that company in the world . Nvidia was my best stock pick for Motley Full Stock Advisor, the company behind AI .  Ricky Mulvey: The direction of the stock market is not parabolic . It's lower left to upper right, not always at the same time and sometimes downward . That's what enables me to buy a Palantir which I did not ten years ago .  Ricky Mulvey: There are things that people should know about Palantir, and that's just part of being a shareholder in them . He says it can create a digital twin of the organization, and then you can go in and decide what needs stocking, where, and what a complex logistics operation .  David Gardner: I still think trees can't grow to the sky more than 90 times enterprise value to revenue . Gardner: Palantir is up about four or five times the value since I first bought. It could be about to drop 50%, as indeed, we saw Nvidia do within the last couple of years .  Ricky Mulvey: I'm watching Netflix lose two thirds of its value in the face of its self inflicted gunshot wound known as Quickstar more than ten years ago, it's not fun to watch companies lose half or more of their value within inside of one year .  David Gardner: I think the earlier stage a company is, the less its valuation matters. The later stage it's, the more it matters. I think there's a perception that in order to really be a smart, successful investor, you need to be able to value stocks, and people will ask you questions, insinuating questions .  When he first wrote, really, when he came on the scene a century ago, the markets were so inefficient . The knowledge gap between people who had a balance sheet and people who couldn't look at the balance sheet was substantial . Over the course of the last century, that's largely been erased, he says .  Ricky Mulvey: Most managers care about what the next earnings are going to be and the quarter after that . David Gardner: There's a huge amount of money just sitting there on the valuations you're seeing every day on the markets .  If you're looking six years ahead instead of six quarters ahead or two quarters ahead, you will actually be playing almost your own game . What you're seeing are valuations that look in a two quarter period as if they're too high .  Most people are not playing the game that you and I will win which is to buy and to hold the great companies of our time . Ricky Mulvey: When you only look for cheap stocks, then you miss out on a lot of the big tech players and market-dominating companies that have emerged in the stock market .  There are times where not looking at valuation can bite investors and there are times when looking at valuations . For those who bought Shopify at the peaks of 2021, they're still down on that at the height of a recent cycle of investing excitement .  David Gardner: I think everybody should start with 20 stocks. With $1,000, you can have a 20 stock portfolio. I don't believe anybody should determine what they think about the stock market and investing directly in stocks based on one stock .  Ricky says dollar-cost averaging into stocks directly is the approach everybody should be taking . Ricky: We should all just constantly be investing every two weeks if we're wage earners, and adding to the market and the best companies that we can find . Ricky says he's not sure Shopify is back to its all time highs yet .  A few months ago there were a lot of people, at least on my Facebook feed saying, I'm shorting Tesla . That was actually probably the worst time to either sell or short the company, but that's still one with a very complicated future .  David Gardner: I think there are people in the let's say left and moderate that say, everywhere I drive. I don't want to necessarily promote a political affiliation with that. That harm to the brand may be undoable. Especially as people are making big purchases with electric cars .  If Tesla's not there for you, don't do it. For me, it is. I'm not about Elon Musk's politics. I think that Elon is a phenomenal innovator across multiple industries. There are lots of people who work at Tesla .  This is a company that created a revolution. Everybody else is still trying to catch up to the electric cars while Tesla is going to start bringing out robots. Robots are a bigger industry than cars and they won't be the only player. But I'm invested, because I love what the company does. I do drive a Tesla and I do so unashamedly .  The stock a year ago, the day we're recording, this conversation is Monday, May 19th was at 175 . Today, it's just short of 350. Ricky Mulvey:I think we're possibly missing the forest for the trees if we're getting too. I'm talking about anybody who thinks this is a serious problem and long term damage .  As we move forward, rule breakers can become rule makers . David Gardner: Not every company that goes through that process, rule breaker to rule maker stops growing at that point .  Amazon is a great example of the rule breakers that continue to break the rules as they lead their industry and the world forward . Netflix, Amazon, Nvidia and Netflix are examples of those who started out with David positioning and are now within their contexts, the Goliath, and they are innovating at a pace intuitive surgical .  I'm always going to have my money on the innovators and I love to find them as early as I can, like we did with Shopify . Shopify looks beautifully positioned to me today over the next 20 years. We're going to keep our investments in. Ricky .  Most people are simply not investing. They are trading which is the antithesis of investing . We are holding for at least three years, preferably three decades and not any company. We are specifically focused on the rule breakers and innovators .  Ricky Mulvey: I just took early retirement because I bought and held Nvidia because you guys did through some thick and some thin. That to me is how to invest. Thanks for listening .

Nvidia’s 66% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible .  Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions . Nvidia’s annualized revenue growth of 140% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting demand was strong and recently accelerated .  Sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 43% over the next 12 months . Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, but we prefer a lesser-known stock benefiting from the rise of AI . Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers .  This quarter, Nvidia’s DIO came in at 59, which is 47 days below its five-year average . At the moment, these numbers show no indication of an excessive inventory buildup . The company's Datacenter revenue missed by a slight amount, and its revenue guidance for next quarter missed .

" $3.3 trillion chipmaker will report its fiscal first-quarter earnings for 2026 on Wednesday . Analysts forecast a revenue surge to $43.26 billion, nearly 66% higher than the same quarter a year ago . Nvidia has a habit of surpassing earnings expectations — topping earnings estimates by an average of about 7% in the last two quarters .  At the heart of Nvidia’s revenue machine is its Data Center business . Analysts expect this division alone to generate $21.27 billion in Q1 revenue . CEO Jensen Huang has positioned Nvidia not just a chipmaker butas the infrastructure layer powering the AI revolution .  Nvidia is moving beyond silicon into networking, software, and cloud integration in a bid to become the full-stack backbone of AI infrastructure . The company is deepening its economic moat and creating more stable, recurring revenue streams .  Wall Street wants to see whether Nvidia’s networking products are contributing to meaningful growth within the data center segment . Margins will also be a key focus for Nvidia, which typically deliver higher profitability than hardware .  Nvidia has long relied on the Chinese market for a sizable chunk of its revenue . But that has changed dramatically in the wake of tightening U.S. export controls and tariffs . Nvidia was once dominant in China with a market share approaching 95% at the start of the Biden administration .  Nvidia is the poster child of the AI trade, and its financial performance serves as a high-frequency indicator of how far the generative AI economy has progressed from hype to hard returns . A strong beat would signal that tech giants are continuing to pour billions into AI infrastructure .  Nvidia’s valuation is rich, but so are many other AI-linked names . If Nvidia meets or beats expectations, it could justify the current risk appetite for high-growth names . A miss, even a tiny one, could trigger a sentiment reset . One looming concern: supply chain capacity .  Investors will be watching closely for details on capital expenditures and supply chain resilience .

" Nvidia’s (NVDA) earnings figures are set to be published tomorrow . The tech giant faces a very high bar—it needs to deliver a standout quarter along with strong guidance to impress the markets . From a business fundamentals perspective, explosive top-line growth and exceptionally high margins for a company of Nvidia's size .  Nvidia posted a massive 78% year-over-year revenue growth, bringing in $39.3 billion . Nvidia's surge has been driven almost entirely by explosive demand for its GPUs . The company added $17 billion in revenue in just one year .  Nvidia reported gross margins of 73% in its latest quarter . That's down from 76% in the same period last year and 74.6% last quarter . Management expects margins to rebound to the 75–76% range by the fiscal year’s end .  Analysts are expecting Q2 revenue of $45.5 billion, which implies 5.8% sequential growth from Q1’s guidance, or 51.7% year-over-year growth . The market consensus is leaning toward the high end of that range—$43.7 billion—essentially putting pressure on Nvidia to not just meet guidance but exceed it .  The market is pricing in a 7.8% move (up or down) around earnings around earnings . Over the past eight quarters, Nvidia stock has moved more than 6% each time . A simple strategy that aligns well with the high volatility expected for Nvidia post-earnings is the strangle .  The total cost of the strangle would then be $6.83 per share, or $683 per contract . The reduced upfront cost makes this strategy more capital-efficient . For the trade to turn profitable, Nvidia’s stock must move significantly—either above $138.13 or below $120.77 . Wall Street analysts remain staunchly bullish on Nvidia .  The long-term bull thesis on Nvidia remains strong, with very few key points to criticize aside from some recent small margin deviations . The challenge is that Nvidia’s bar is as high as the operational quality of its business demands . A strangle options strategy could be a smart way to capitalize on big moves in the stock price .",positive,"nvidia, revenue, nvda, earnings, profitable"

" Nvidia is set to report its fiscal first-quarter operating results after the closing bell today (May 28) Nvidia's graphics processing unit (GPU) dominance in AI-accelerated data centers, coupled with AI-GPU scarcity, has helped it ascend to the top .

It's a reasonably important tech company with a $360 billion market cap that was prominently known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) Nvidia's Hopper (H100) and successor Blackwell (Black Blackwell) GPUs have been the backbone of AI-accelerated data centers .  Businesses eager to build out their AI-data center infrastructure have found AI-focused GPUs are in short supply . Nvidia has had little issue raising its prices and charging two to four times more per chip than rivals . CEO Jensen Huang aims to bring a more powerful and energy-efficient chip to market annually through 2027 .  Nvidia has a better-than-average chance of surpassing Wall Street's consensus sales and EPS forecast for the fiscal first quarter . Nvidia has topped analysts' consensus EPS forecasts for nine consecutive quarters . No external competitors are particularly close to dethroning Nvidia in terms of compute abilities .  Nvidia's (expected) four-quarter decline in GAAP gross margin looks to be directly related to the AI boom . The company is generating considerably more in net sales now than it was even one year ago when it had a 78.4% gross margin .  Nvidia has relied on AI-GPU scarcity to charge an exorbitant premium for its Hopper and Blackwell chips . With this scarcity now diminishing, there's the real possibility of Nvidia's pricing power fading .  Nvidia reports its fiscal first quarter results after the bell on May 28 .

" In this podcast, Motley Fool co-founder and Chief Rule Breaker David Gardner joins host Ricky Mulvey for a conversation about how he thinks about valuation . They discuss Palantir's current valuation, and what investors should prepare for . The value of paying up for ""top dogs"" and holding on to them for long periods of time .  Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, available when you joinStock Advisor . Apple:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008,you’d have $37,070!* Netflix: If you invested in the company in 2004, you'd have $639,271!  Motley Fool co-founder and chief Rule Breaker David Gardner joined us for a conversation on today's show . Gardner: I've been thinking a lot about and not buying, maybe to my detriment, a company called Palantir . At the time of this writing, it's got a blistering valuation, about 95 times enterprise value to revenue .  David Gardner: Rule Breaker is focused not on all the stocks or the whole market . I focus on the innovator in each industry. That is trait number one of rule Breaker stocks and there are six traits .  You will never buy Palantir if you're trying to find a cheap, says Ricky Mulvey . That's true industry by industry, Ricky, for the rule breakers. who's the first mover, not just any industry . That, for me, is the way to maximize your returns as an investor .  David Gardner: Why are all the best companies always trading at premium valuations? Why wasIntuitive Surgicalwhen I first picked it in 2005, trading at something like 75 times earnings . Yet, it's gone up more than 100 times in value since then in the 20 succeeding years . Virtually every great company from Tesla to Netflix, the list goes on .  The performance of a company and the quality of its stock over time is directly correlated to its brand . Who the CEO is, what's the culture of the company? Can it innovate its way out of a box? What about its brand? None of those four is included anywhere in the financial statements .  Ricky Mulvey: What about their brand, the promise you make to your customers every day? This is an incredibly important point. It's one I try to make big in my rule Breaker Investing book that comes out this fall .  Some of the biggest winners in the full universe, some of which you mentioned, Amazon, Netflix, Mercado Libre, I use Y charts, which sometimes can mess some things up, especially for historic multiples . These often traded above ten times enterprise value to revenue, sometimes even 45 times if you look at an early Amazon . But, that's a comparative value town to where Palantir is today, which is a more mature company .  David Gardner: I think it's natural to recognize when companies are at all time high, not just for their stock, but for their valuation multiples . Gardner: When I buy a stock at a dead minimum, I'm holding it for at least three years. Preferably three decades. What ends up mattering is not the valuation multiple that you paid for 17 or seven years ago, which I can't even remember now. What matters far more.  The companies that are winning for everybody, not equally in all the time, but the companies that just keep winning, are winning . What really matters is the impact of that company in the world . Nvidia was my best stock pick for Motley Full Stock Advisor, the company behind AI .  Ricky Mulvey: The direction of the stock market is not parabolic . It's lower left to upper right, not always at the same time and sometimes downward . That's what enables me to buy a Palantir which I did not ten years ago .  Ricky Mulvey: There are things that people should know about Palantir, and that's just part of being a shareholder in them . He says it can create a digital twin of the organization, and then you can go in and decide what needs stocking, where, and what a complex logistics operation .  David Gardner: I still think trees can't grow to the sky more than 90 times enterprise value to revenue . Gardner: Palantir is up about four or five times the value since I first bought. It could be about to drop 50%, as indeed, we saw Nvidia do within the last couple of years .  Ricky Mulvey: I'm watching Netflix lose two thirds of its value in the face of its self inflicted gunshot wound known as Quickstar more than ten years ago, it's not fun to watch companies lose half or more of their value within inside of one year .  David Gardner: I think the earlier stage a company is, the less its valuation matters. The later stage it's, the more it matters. I think there's a perception that in order to really be a smart, successful investor, you need to be able to value stocks, and people will ask you questions, insinuating questions .  When he first wrote, really, when he came on the scene a century ago, the markets were so inefficient . The knowledge gap between people who had a balance sheet and people who couldn't look at the balance sheet was substantial . Over the course of the last century, that's largely been erased, he says .  Ricky Mulvey: Most managers care about what the next earnings are going to be and the quarter after that . David Gardner: There's a huge amount of money just sitting there on the valuations you're seeing every day on the markets .  If you're looking six years ahead instead of six quarters ahead or two quarters ahead, you will actually be playing almost your own game . What you're seeing are valuations that look in a two quarter period as if they're too high .  Most people are not playing the game that you and I will win which is to buy and to hold the great companies of our time . Ricky Mulvey: When you only look for cheap stocks, then you miss out on a lot of the big tech players and market-dominating companies that have emerged in the stock market .  There are times where not looking at valuation can bite investors and there are times when looking at valuations . For those who bought Shopify at the peaks of 2021, they're still down on that at the height of a recent cycle of investing excitement .  David Gardner: I think everybody should start with 20 stocks. With $1,000, you can have a 20 stock portfolio. I don't believe anybody should determine what they think about the stock market and investing directly in stocks based on one stock .  Ricky says dollar-cost averaging into stocks directly is the approach everybody should be taking . Ricky: We should all just constantly be investing every two weeks if we're wage earners, and adding to the market and the best companies that we can find . Ricky says he's not sure Shopify is back to its all time highs yet .  A few months ago there were a lot of people, at least on my Facebook feed saying, I'm shorting Tesla . That was actually probably the worst time to either sell or short the company, but that's still one with a very complicated future .  David Gardner: I think there are people in the let's say left and moderate that say, everywhere I drive. I don't want to necessarily promote a political affiliation with that. That harm to the brand may be undoable. Especially as people are making big purchases with electric cars .  If Tesla's not there for you, don't do it. For me, it is. I'm not about Elon Musk's politics. I think that Elon is a phenomenal innovator across multiple industries. There are lots of people who work at Tesla .  This is a company that created a revolution. Everybody else is still trying to catch up to the electric cars while Tesla is going to start bringing out robots. Robots are a bigger industry than cars and they won't be the only player. But I'm invested, because I love what the company does. I do drive a Tesla and I do so unashamedly .  The stock a year ago, the day we're recording, this conversation is Monday, May 19th was at 175 . Today, it's just short of 350. Ricky Mulvey:I think we're possibly missing the forest for the trees if we're getting too. I'm talking about anybody who thinks this is a serious problem and long term damage .  As we move forward, rule breakers can become rule makers . David Gardner: Not every company that goes through that process, rule breaker to rule maker stops growing at that point .  Amazon is a great example of the rule breakers that continue to break the rules as they lead their industry and the world forward . Netflix, Amazon, Nvidia and Netflix are examples of those who started out with David positioning and are now within their contexts, the Goliath, and they are innovating at a pace intuitive surgical .  I'm always going to have my money on the innovators and I love to find them as early as I can, like we did with Shopify . Shopify looks beautifully positioned to me today over the next 20 years. We're going to keep our investments in. Ricky .  Most people are simply not investing. They are trading which is the antithesis of investing . We are holding for at least three years, preferably three decades and not any company. We are specifically focused on the rule breakers and innovators .  Ricky Mulvey: I just took early retirement because I bought and held Nvidia because you guys did through some thick and some thin. That to me is how to invest. Thanks for listening .

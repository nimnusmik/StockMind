While telecom sector has embraced generative AI at pace, many deployments fall short of true operational integration .  These agents deliver network-aware, context-sensitive responses and executing intelligent decision-making rooted in domain expertise . Ontology is the Backbone of Telco Intelligence for AI agents to operate effectively in the telecommunications industry .  well-defined telco ontology provides AI agents with a contextual understanding of service plans, technical specifications, billing structures, and customer interactions . This structured framework ensures AI agents deliver accurate, relevant, and uniform responses, while allowing for seamless collaboration across systems and sub-agents .  For operators, a digital twin is a real-time virtual replica of their physical network . Data, analytics, and AI/ML form the core foundation of any effective digital twin . Simulation plays a critical role by offering a safe and scalable environment to train and test AI agents . It allows agentic AI to learn complex decision-making, anticipate outcomes, adapt strategies, and operate autonomously .  As AI agents become the first touchpoint between companies and their customers, how they sound, look, and respond carries real brand weight . 80% of consumers said they trust AI agents to resolve service issues . 60% believe AI can positively shape their perception of a brand-when done right .  Enterprise-grade agents must also possess robust non-functional capabilities . These horizontal capabilities encompass crucial aspects like trust and security, which are fundamental to the reliability and effectiveness of GenAI solutions in the telecommunications sector .

" Investor sentiment and risk appetite rebounded sharply on Monday as fears around the Israel-Iran conflict subsided . In my column today I look at why the dollar's status as a safe-haven asset in times of heightened geopolitical uncertainty may be fading . More on that below, but first, a roundup of the main market moves .  Oil slides as much as 4% at one stage on Monday but Brent futures settle only 1.35% lower at $73.23/bbl .

The Bank of Japan will deliver its policy decision on Tuesday .  Dollar fared better than U.S. stocks or Treasuries, which both fell sharply on Friday . But with oil surging over 7% and gold up a solid 1.5%, a strong 'flight to quality' flow would have lifted the dollar more than a quarter of one percent .  The dollar has historically been one of the best hedges against short-term volatility sparked by geopolitical risk . The dollar accounts for almost 60% of the world's $12 trillion FX reserves, with its nearest rival, the euro, accounting for around 60% .  Almost two-thirds of global debt is denominated in dollars, and nearly 90% of all FX transactions around the world have the greenback on one side of the trade . However, the dollar's downside 'structural' risks are growing, analysts at Westpac noted on Sunday .  If the Israel-Iran conflict continues to escalate, that dollar smile could get rather lopsided . The idea was first outlined over 20 years ago by then currency analyst Stephen Jen .

" Every game-changing technology and innovation since (and including) the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s has navigated its way through an early-stage bubble . Other factors, which includes competitive pressures, CEO Jensen Huang's accelerated innovation timeline, and President Donald Trump's tariff and trade policy, suggest Nvidia stock is riskier than investors realize .  Nvidia's Hopper (H100) and Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs) have been the undeniable top options by businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers . But there are tangible, historical, and statistical reasons to believe Nvidia is, indeed, fallible .  Nvidia accounts for a near-monopoly like share of the GPUs currently deployed in AI accelerated data centers . AMD's Instinct series chips are notably cheaper and more readily accessible than Nvidia's hardware, which suggests it should have no issue chipping away at Nvidia's leading data center .  Many of Nvidia's top clients by net sales are internally developing AI-GPUs and solutions to use in their data centers . Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is sparing no expense to ensure that his company maintains its compute advantages .  Nvidia's biggest competitive edge in AI has been its ability to exploit AI-GPU scarcity . As long as GPU demand overwhelms supply, Nvidia can notably increase its prices, boost its production, and benefit from both ends . But we're already observing evidence that AI-PU scarcity is waning .  China is one of Nvidia's most important individual markets and generates billions of dollars in quarterly sales . The federal government has stymied Nvidia's top AI hardware to the world's No. 2 economy . President Trump's tariff and trade policy threatens to throw a monkey wrench into Nvidia's expansion plans .  In December 2020, two sons of Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress each purchased 100 shares of Nvidia . This purchase is the last time an executive, board member, or direct family member, bought shares . In comparison, there have been 172 separate sales by insiders since Kress's Form 4 was filed in 2020 .  Wall Street's brightest money managers have been persistent sellers of Nvidia stock for more than a year . Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office and Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital completely exited their once sizable positions in this AI kingpin . Only one reason to buy: you believe shares will head higher .  Nvidia's trailing-12-month (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 24 remains in nosebleed territory, relative to other megacap stocks that have been on the leading edge of next-big-thing trends . For instance, key players in the evolution of the internet, such asAmazon,Microsoft, andCisco Systems, all topped out with P/S ratios ranging from 30 to 43 before the dot-com bubble burst .

The partnership between OpenAI and Alphabet is a big win for Alphabet's cloud business . I'll break down which AI data center stock I think is poised to benefit most from this deal .

" Shares of electric vehicle manufacturerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)have dropped by 21% on the year . While Tesla's core EV business continues to struggle, I think shares are poised for an epic comeback . A bullish narrative surrounding robotaxi has fueled some recent excitement in Tesla stock as of late .  Tesla investors understand that Elon Musk's vision for the company is not just to sell the most EVs . Musk has been focusing on various elements of artificial intelligence (AI) and how the technology can be used to transform Tesla . Right now, the most immediate AI use case for Tesla is commercializing autonomous driving software .  Among Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, these three cloud computing giants are forecast to spend nearly $260 billion in AIcapital expenditures just this year . Investors might want to see some tangible return on investment in the form of accelerating revenue and widening profit margins .  The primary catalyst fueling Tesla stock right now seems to be the robotaxi launch . At its core, the company's self-driving technology is a software product -- meaning it carries higher profit margins than the traditional automobile business .  Tesla stock has steadily been climbing over the last month-and-a-half . But I would caution investors from buying into the idea that now is an opportunity to take advantage of a dip . Musk himself has made it explicitly clear that the robotaxi will not be a meaningful financial contributor for Tesla for at least a year .  Tesla stock will outperform its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers over the next six months . But I actually think investing in the stock is a bit risky at the moment . A more prudent approach to an investment in Tesla is to see how the Robotaxi business scalers in the coming months while learning how impactful this new segment is for the entire business .

" A strategic endorsement from Nvidia lit a fire under this under-the-radar AI power play yesterday . The question now is whether this rally has staying power -- or whether investors have already missed the moment . With roughly 12.8% of Navitas shares sold short before the announcement, this explosive move has triggered a mix of excitement and skepticism .  Navitas is at the center of one of the most ambitious infrastructure overhauls in AI history . The collaboration involves replacing today's antiquated 54V power architecture with a revolutionary 800V HVDC standard capable of supporting IT racks of 1 megawatt . Current data center infrastructure maxes out at a few hundred kilowatts per rack .  Navitas' gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors are central to delivering this transformation . GaNFast and GeneSiC technologies enable the high-frequency switching and thermal efficiency required for 800V systems . For hyperscale operators managing thousands of racks, these improvements translate millions in operational savings .  As of the latest report, 12.8% of Navitas' float was sold short -- an unusually high level for a small-cap tech name . The high short interest suggests many investors had written off Navitas as another struggling semiconductor company . The Nvidia announcement forced a rapid reassessment .  Navitas has suddenly moved from obscurity to center stage in the next phase of the AI infrastructure build . The company generated approximately $83 million in revenue in 2024 but posted a net loss of nearly the same amount . Navitas remains a speculative stock, but the asymmetric upside has sharpened considerably .  Navitas Semiconductor is a high-risk, high-reward option on the larger AI infrastructure build .

It created the free software platform to allow developers to be able to program its chips for purposes beyond their original intent of helping speed up graphics rendering in video games .  The company does not have a recurring revenue stream like a software company, so it relies on increased demand for its chips . Right now, it appears that AI infrastructure spending is poised to continue to ramp up . Meanwhile, the stock is attractively valued, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of under 31 times this year's analyst estimates .  Alphabet's Google search engine has a dominant position in search, with an approximate 90% global market share . However, there is no doubt that AI chatbots are gaining momentum and beginning to become more mainstream . Google Search doesn't make much money from searches involving things like helping students with a biology paper .  Alphabet is the default search engine on most devices connected to the internet .

" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang flew out of Taipei on Friday after a week revelling in the adoration of Taiwan's tech industry . Investors fear a drop in spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure as well as damage to sales from trade friction . U.S. restrictions on high-tech exports have seen Nvidia lose market share in China as it withdraws chips .  Nvidia's NVLink Fusion allows companies to plug custom chips into Nvidia's AI infrastructure . Huang: ""AI infrastructure is being built out (everywhere) - that's one of the reasons I'm travelling around the world""  The bet is that drawing companies to build hardware that utilises Nvidia's Fusion platform will drive demand for the underlying AI network and data centre parts that Nvidia sells . The enterprise market is large but difficult to break into, says Seaport Research's Goldberg .  Huang is perceived as a local-born hero hailing from Taiwan's historic capital of Tainan before migrating to the U.S. when he was nine years old . Huang has appeared on stage or at banquets with nearly every prominent Taiwanese tech executive .  Solomon Technology, a provider of industrial automation and AI-based inspection solutions, uses Nvidia's software tools .

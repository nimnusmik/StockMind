By 2030, Coatue is forecasting a market capitalization of $5.6 trillion for Nvidia -- implying nearly 60% upside from current levels .

While both scenarios present a degree of uncertainty surrounding Nvidia, I see each of them as short-term issues . Thinking longer-term, however, Nvidia's growth prospects appear bright .  Nvidia's near-term growth may give off the appearance of deceleration given challenges in China .

McKinsey & Company recently reported that AI infrastructure spend could reach $6.7 trillion by 2030 .

" Artificial intelligence (AI) investing doesn't have to be hard . Nvidia's GPUs have built most of the AI technology we experience today . Taiwan Semiconductor's chips power nearly every AI device . Broadcom's connectivity switches and XPUs are slated to grow as inference becomes more common .  Nvidia can't make chips, so it farms that work out to Taiwan Semiconductor, the world's leading contract chip manufacturer . The company's facilities allow it to produce the most advanced chips in the world at an impressive yield . Nearly every competitor in the AI arms race uses TSMC's chips .  Broadcom partners with AI hyperscalers to develop their own custom AI accelerators . Nvidia cited a third-party research company's projection that data center capital expenditures will rise from $400 billion in 2024 to $1 trillion by 2028 . While this technology isn't going to replace GPUs, it complements them in a well-rounded AI infrastructure buildout .  Taiwan Semiconductor's management is very bullish on its growth prospects, thanks to AI . Broadcom may have the most bullish outlook, as it's slated to see huge growth as AI inference begins to take over . Nvidia would be an excellent stock to buy now .

" The majority of Nvidia's revenue comes from its data center business, thanks to booming sales of its industry-leading artificial intelligence chips . Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks autonomous vehicles could be the next trillion-dollar opportunity for the company . The company's automotive revenue could triple during fiscal 2026 .  Self-driving car requires AI software which is trained on millions of hours of real-world data to ensure it's equipped to safely deal with every possible scenario . Building a roadworthy autonomous vehicle isn't easy, and only a small handful of companies have success .  The data center business is the dominant contributor to Nvidia's revenue . During the first quarter of 2026, the automotive segment generated $567 million in revenue, accounting for just 1.3% of the company's total . Nvidia's Drive platform is a complete hardware and software solution that includes the powerful Thor chip .  Earlier this year Jensen Huang said Nvidia's automotive revenue could come in at $5 billion for the whole of fiscal 2026, which would be a whopping 194% increase from its fiscal 2025 result of $1.7 billion . But that's not all, because car manufacturers are starting to invest heavily in Nvidia's other products to customize and refine their self-driving offering .  According to Wall Street's consensus estimate, Nvidia could deliver $199 billion in total revenue during fiscal 2026 . Even if its automotive revenue triples to $5 billion, it would still be a very small part of the overall business . Investors who buy Nvidia stock today are still doing so for the strength of its data center segment .  Nvidia stock will have to climb 38% over the next 12 months or so just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 33.5: That means if Wall Street's forecast proves to be accurate, Nvidia stock would have to soar by 79% to trade in line with its 10-year average P.E ratio . But investors might want to focus on the longer term considering autonomous driving has the potential to become yet another trillion-dollar opportunity for the company .

" Only one ""Magnificent Seven"" company hasn’t yet split its stock . Stock splits make it easier for a broader range of investors to buy the shares . Meta Platforms has soared more than 300% over the past three years .  Companies split their stock by simply offering more shares to current holders . The value of each share would be worth less than it was prior to the operation, but the total value of your holding would remain the same . Nvidia and Amazon completed splits, along with other technology giants such as Broadcomand Alphabet .  Meta shares trade for more than $600, outpacing the rest of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks that led the stock market higher last year . The exception is social media and AI powerhouse Meta, which has completed a stock split . The stock's price tag could dissuade investors or make it difficult for some investors to access it .  Meta is known for its social media apps, led by the flagship Facebook . The tech giant could decide to launch a split in the months to come . A split also is a great idea at this point in Meta's story because it offers investors a positive message .  Meta Platforms. has developed its own large language model, Llama, and is using it to power features across its apps .

" Investors have flocked to Palantir Technologies stock due to its sustained moat, cash-rich balance sheet, and ideal positioning with Donald Trump as president . The ability for AI-empowered software and systems to make split-second decisions without the oversight of humans is a technology with broad-reaching potential in most industries around the globe .  When 2023 began, Palantir was a company of fringe importance in the tech sector . But following a greater than 2,000% gain in two and a half years, it's become the eighth-largest publicly traded U.S. tech stock .  Palantir's two core operating segments -- Gotham and Foundry -- lack large-scale competition . Wall Street loves predictability, and Palantirs shifted to recurring profits well ahead of the consensus from Wall Street .  Palantir Technologies closed out the March-ended quarter with $5.43 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, with no debt . The company has demonstrated that its operating model is viable and time-tested . The icing on the cake for Wall Street and investors is Donald Trump's November victory .  Palantir is cash-rich, profitable, and capable of sustaining its competitive moat . But even fantastic businesses can run into historical headwinds . Every major technological advancement since (and including) the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s has seen investors overestimate early innings adoption .  Palantir's multiyear contracts via Gotham and subscriptions from Foundry would help insulate its top-line results from an immediate drop-off if the AI bubble bursts . However, investor sentiment would still be expected to weigh heavily on the company's valuation . The second significant downside catalyst is its valuation .  As of the closing bell on June 20, Palantir's TTM P/S ratio was tipping the scales at (drum roll) 110! No megacap company on the leading edge of a next-big-thing trend has been able to maintain a TTM (P/S) ratio of 30 to 40 for a considerable length of time .

" Since the midpoint of 2023, billionaire David Tepper has been a fairly persistent seller of artificial intelligence (AI)-graphics processing unit (GPUs) developers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices . Tepper opened a position in one of the newest members of the trillion-dollar club during the March-ended quarter .  Global gross domestic product is expected to jump by 26% come 2030 solely because of AI . Wall Street's smartest money managers have approached their trading activity in leading AI stocks . No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management must file Form 13F .  Tepper is a big fan of the rise of AI, but he's been quite picky about the artificial intelligence stocks he's buying and selling . Tepper has shown two of the biggest players in the AI-graphics processing unit (GPU) space to the door .  Tepper's position in AMD was whittled down from a peak of 2.31 million shares in the June-ended quarter in 2023 to no shares remaining, as of March 31, 2025 -- a decline of 97% . Tepper might have been locking in gains, but there may be more to this selling activity than that .  There hasn't been a game-changing innovation in decades that's avoided a bubble early in its expansion phase . The fact that most businesses haven't yet optimized their Ai solutions and aren't generating a positive return on their AI investments suggests AI is a long way from being a mature technology .  Appaloosa's head investor opened a 130,000-share position in AI-networking specialist Broadcom during the first quarter . Broadcom's integral role in the AI arena is to connect large numbers of GPUs to maximize their compute capabilities and minimize tail latency .  The bulk of Broadcom's growth and net sales are currently derived from the rise of AI and its advanced chips . In fiscal 2024, Broadcom delivered $51.6 billion in sales . CEO Hock Tan sees AI-related sales jumping to between $60 billion and $90 billion by fiscal 2027 .  Broadcom has leaned on acquisitions as a means to expand its product and service ecosystem . If the AI bubble were to burst, Broadcom would be expected to navigate a challenging environment for tech stocks far better than Nvidia .

" SoFi recently set quarterly records for revenue, new customers, and product additions . AppLovin's AI tools and performance-based business model are impressing advertisers .

In its fiscal 2026 first quarter, Nvidia reported $44.1 billion in revenue, up 12% from the previous quarter and 69% year over year . Nvidia has a 92% share of the GPU market, leaving rival chipmakers behind .

SoFi also has some unusual offerings, particularly among its investment products .  SoFi set new records on net revenue ($772 million, up 20% year over year), new members (it added 800,000, bringing its total to 10.9 million) Even with that growth, SoFi is still a long way from competing on the same level as the major nationwide banks . There's also the possibility that macroeconomic uncertainty could hurt SoFi's business .  AppLovin has gone all-in on AI with the development of Axon, its AI-powered advertising engine .

Nvidia isn't immune to economic downturns and recessions, but expansion of its AI chipmaking business could offset that pressure .  Nvidia once generated most of its revenue from its gaming GPUs . But in its latest quarter, 89% came from its data center GPUs . Data center GPUs are better suited for processing complex AI tasks than stand-alone CPUs .  Analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings per share to grow at compound annual growth rates of 30% and 28% from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028 .

" The ETF landscape is becoming increasingly complex, with most new launches being actively managed and many employing derivatives . Some of the newest products combine options-selling strategies with leveraged single-stock ETFs . This article takes a closer look at ETFs that trade options on single stocks to generate exceptionally high yields .  YieldMax currently offers more than 50 ETFs in U.S. markets, with total assets under management of about $14 billion . The suite has grown rapidly, largely driven by its headline-grabbing distribution yields of 100% or more . Inspired by this success, many copycat ETFs have entered the market .  The YieldMax Reddit community has around 50,000 members, many of whom discuss using these ETFs to replace their 9-to-5 jobs or to generate retirement income .

Another provider, Kurv Investment Management, offers six Yield Premium ETFs that use derivatives on single technology stocks . Current distribution rates range between 12% and 29% . The most popular fund manages just over $22 million .  Of the 24 YieldMax ETFs we examined, some underlying stocks surged, some declined, and others remained relatively flat .

Single-Stock Option Income ETFs vs. Diversified ETFs sell one-month call options with strike prices slightly above the current stock price . In doing so, investors give up much of the upside if the stock rises while still bearing most of the downside if it falls . JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI uses a bottom-up fundamental process to construct a diversified, defensive portfolio of 125 stocks .  If you expect the stock to decline, it’s best to steer clear of any product linked to it . These ETFs may outperform if the underlying stock remains range-bound . However, since they use market swings as an income-generating strategy, don’t expect jumbo distributions .  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is one of the leading companies in the U.S. market . Tesla, Inc.

Scrapping the AI diffusion framework won't change the measures targeting China . Instead, it would provide fresh opportunities for other countries to negotiate their own chip access . Those deals could be influenced by investment promises or broader trade and diplomatic considerations .  The AI diffusion rule, unveiled during Biden’s final week in office, expanded those licensing requirements to most of the world . It included caps on total shipments to places like the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which already had to obtain US government approval for advanced chip imports under the 2023 regulations .  Trump officials intend to impose curbs on countries that have diverted chips to China, including Malaysia and Thailand . The Commerce Department will continue to strictly enforce existing chip export rules . Nvidia, the leading maker of chips for training AI models, has objected to the growing number of US restrictions .  The changes could be a boon to companies like Oracle, which is planning a data center expansion in Malaysia that was set to blow past AI diffusion rule limits .

The goal of such a provision would be to help Saudi Arabia foster an “attractive environment for foreign governments and private sector entities to develop and adopt such technologies for peaceful purposes and uses, draft law says .

" Nvidia (NVDA) stock has been a letdown for investors this year, mirroring the broader market pullback . The once glittering Wall Street darling, whom so many investors were calling overvalued, is now available with a sturdy discount . Nvidia is well-positioned to ride the wave of secularAItrends. But in the short term, the stock trading below its long-term averages and losing momentum suggests this .  The buzz around Nvidia has cooled off in recent months, even though the company's fundamentals haven't given investors a good reason to back away . Data centers remain the backbone of Nvidia’s business, accounting for more than 90% of total sales . Nvidia still holds an impressive operating margin of around 62.4% over the last year .  Nvidia is expected to grow its EPS by 35.2% annually over the next three to five years . That’s nearly double its five-year average and way above the industry average of just 5.8% . Nvidia has a PEG ratio of just 0.2x, which is extremely low compared to its peers and historical figures . But with U.S.-China tensions running hotter than ever, the threat of a full-blown trade war could seriously pressure Nvidia's growth outlook .  In the past 30 days, revenue growth projections have been cut by 4% for 2029 and another 3% for 2030 and 2031 . For a stock priced for perfection and needing to sustain a 30%+ CAGR to justify its “cheap” PEG, such revisions start to matter . Once growth is factored in, it makes sense to own Nvidia most of the time .  Nvidia’s annualized volatility is high, currently around 59%. So, leaning on long-term moving averages like the 200-day line helps cut through the noise . Using this strategy would have delivered a 62.8% compound annual return over the last 10 years .  Most Wall Street analysts covering Nvidia stock are stoutly confident that now is a good time to buy . Over the past three months, 34 out of 40 analysts have rated NVDA as a Buy, with five staying neutral and just one leaning bearish .

" Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been a disappointing stock over the past year . Since May 2024, AMD has been down almost 32% . AMD has also struggled with a lack of competitiveness in absorbing that demand .  The first five months of 2025 have been marked by growing uncertainty around demand for infrastructure chips . Super Micro Computer recently posted results with a weaker-than-expected outlook for the upcoming quarter, citing delays in AI server orders .  Big Tech companies are increasingly buying chips directly from manufacturers like Nvidia and AMD, and building AI systems in-house, bypassing integrators like SMCI . The market remains skeptical about infrastructure chipmakers, especially AMD .  Most of the current AI buildout is GPU-driven, rather than focused on traditional CPUs . AMD is effectively left with pent-up demand, which it hasn't been able to unlock . As a result, AMD continues to lag behind NVIDIA in absorbing the surging demand for AI infrastructure .  AMD is currently priced near the lowest levels seen in the last three years, having hit a low of 19x just a few weeks ago . That’sa significant drop from its peak multiple of 63x in Q1 of last year . The lower multiple suggests AMD could be de-risked enough to justify a bullish thesis, but it also reflects investors’ hesitation to pay a premium for its long-term story .  AMD is trading at a PEG ratio of 0.8x, making it look even cheaper relative to growth . For short-term traders looking to navigate AMD’s high volatility, which amounts to around 45% annually, a more tactical approach is key . I suggest a strategy based on moving average crossovers—specifically watching fora bullish signal when the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day .  AMD recently posted a decent quarter, but it comes amid some paradoxes in the AI infrastructure chip market . AMD’s valuation may appear more de-risked than in years, but I would still wait for more explicit confirmation of a bullish trend before initiating a long position .",negative,"amd, cpus, chipmakers, gpu, micro"

AMD is effectively left with pent-up demand, which it hasn't been able to unlock . As a result, AMD continues to lag behind NVIDIA in absorbing the surging demand for AI infrastructure .  AMD is currently priced near the lowest levels seen in the last three years, having hit a low of 19x just a few weeks ago . That’sa significant drop from its peak multiple of 63x in Q1 of last year . The lower multiple suggests AMD could be de-risked enough to justify a bullish thesis, but it also reflects investors’ hesitation to pay a premium for its long-term story .  AMD is trading at a PEG ratio of 0.8x, making it look even cheaper relative to growth . For short-term traders looking to navigate AMD’s high volatility, which amounts to around 45% annually, a more tactical approach is key . I suggest a strategy based on moving average crossovers—specifically watching fora bullish signal when the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day .  AMD recently posted a decent quarter, but it comes amid some paradoxes in the AI infrastructure chip market . AMD’s valuation may appear more de-risked than in years, but I would still wait for more explicit confirmation of a bullish trend before initiating a long position .",negative,"amd, cpus, chipmakers, gpu, micro"

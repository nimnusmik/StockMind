" The big winner of the first phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has clearly been Nvidia . As competition heats up in the AI chips market, cloud services providers could benefit . As the AI revolution rolls on, other companies may supplant Nvidia .  In 2022, Nvidia generated about $27 billion in revenue . As of its most recent quarter, the company reported $130 billion . That's shockingly fast growth, and it's often cited for why Nvidia's share price has risen 800% .  As the market for AI chips becomes more saturated, who will benefit? My investing instincts point to one of the big buyers of AI chips . Amazon, through its Amazon Web Services division, controls around 30% of the cloud services market . Amazon's market share is roughly equal to Microsoft's combined AI chip market share .  Next phase of AI revolution could see the focus shift away from AI infrastructure (GPUs) and toward practical AI . Amazon stock, with its leading position in that key market, could ultimately outperform Nvidia stock in the long term . The cloud infrastructure market is enormous (ataround $700 billion) and red-hot, growing at around 15% year over year .

" Intel has largely given up on selling AI accelerators directly and is focusing on rack-scale solutions . While Gaudi 3 won some high-profile customers, namely IBM for its watsonx platform, the chip was mostly a bust . AMD is set to roll out its new Helios AI solution next year, likely beating Intel to market .  Intel abandoned Falcon Shores, which was expected to be a traditional GPU that integrated some of Gaudi's features . The new plan is to use its successor, Jaguar Shores as the base for rack-scale AI solutions . As AI infrastructure companies scale up data centers to include more densely packed accelerators .  Intel's CEO recently installed a new AI chief in charge of the company's AI strategy and product roadmap . AMD announced its next-generation Helios rack-scale AI solution earlier this month .

Nvidia's powerful chips are used to help power AI workloads, and demand has been soaring . The company's wide moat comes from its CUDA software platform . In Q1, the company had an over 90% market share in the GPU space .  As AI infrastructure spending continues to ramp up, Nvidia remains a clear winner . Another company taking advantage of the AI infrastructure build-out is Broadcom . Last quarter, its AI networking revenue soared 70% and accounted for 40% of its AI revenue .  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the company that actually manufactures most of these AI chips . It's the clear leader in advanced semiconductor manufacturing and a key partner to top chip makers . On the software side, Broadcom also benefits from transitioning VMWare customers from perpetual licenses to a subscription models .  High-performance computing now makes up 59% of its revenue, up from 46% a year ago . The company is working closely with its largest customers to build out capacity in lockstep with demand .

" Quantum Computing, Inc. (QUBT) is up 8.5% so far this week, with bullish sentiment at its peak . Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang offered a much more optimistic outlook, sparking a rally in quantum stocks . Despite the broader enthusiasm for “lifting all boats” in the sector, I remain bearish on QUBT .  Nvidia has launched a new quantum computing research lab in Boston, reinforcing its leadership in the space . Huang’s bullish tone may inspire increased venture capital and R&D investment across the quantum ecosystem . Many still view practical quantum applications as decades away .  Quantum Computing’s first-quarter 2025 earnings highlight just how early-stage its business remains . The technology faces persistent challenges, including qubit fragility, high error rates, and scalability limitations .  Quantum Computing’s market cap, despite minimal revenue, highlights an apparent disconnect from fundamentals . While the company holds $166 million in cash and cash equivalents, its R&D budget is modest compared to that of deep-pocketed rivals .  Quantum Computing’s analyst coverage is limited. Reflecting its speculative nature, the analyst coverage of the company is limited . It's difficult to envision a near-term path where Quantum Computing scales its niche technology into a broadly commercial product in a way that meaningfully rewards shareholders .  The outlook for pure-play firms like Quantum Computing Inc. remains highly speculative . With minimal revenue, the company is still far from its own inflection point, where its products gain broad commercial viability . Reaching that stage will likely require scientific breakthroughs and significant R&D investment .  This is difficult to justify at this stage, especially as it is not clear if it will be used in the future .

" AMD, Broadcom, and Nvidia are all cheap chip stocks given their projected growth . Salesforce and Adobe are two SaaS companies riding the AI wave that have fallen into the bargain bin . Stocks with PEGs under 1 are generally considered undervalued .  AMD is one of the cheapest stocks in the AI space -- if it can live up to its growth expectations . The company has already been seeing solid growth, with its overall revenue climbing by 36% last quarter to $7.44 billion . Its data center segment revenue surged 57% to $3.7 billion last quarter .  Broadcom is another cheap chip stock with a big opportunity in front of it . Revenue jumped 25% last quarter to $14.9 billion, led by a 70% surge in its networking revenue . The company sees its three furthest-along custom AI chip customers being a $60 billion to $90 billion market opportunity .  The biggest risk for Broadcom would be a slowdown in AI infrastructure spending . Salesforce.com has strong data-center and AI opportunities ahead . With a forward PEG of around 0.5, the stock is in the bargain bin .  Nvidia is still the dominant market share leader when it comes to AI chips . It had an incredible 92% market share in the GPU space in Q1 . The company has grown its data center revenue ninefold over the past two years .  Adobe isn't a high-growth stock, but with a PEG of 0.8, it's fallen into the category of growth at a reasonable price (GARP) While AI isn't helping accelerate revenue growth, it has helped it settle in a nice, high-single-digit, low-double-digit range . An AI infrastructure spending slowdown is a risk, but the stock is far from being priced for perfection .  FireFly can help users generate images, video, audio, and vector content that they can further manipulate with Adobe's creative tools, such as Photoshop . Document Cloud and Express have also incorporated FireFly into their platform and can handle everything from summarizing documents in Document Cloud to text-to-video generation in Express .

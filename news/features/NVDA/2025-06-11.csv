Quantum computers use a different paradigm that takes advantage of the peculiarities of quantum mechanics . They use qubits, which can be ones or zeroes, but can also have values that are probability amplitudes . The downsides are that quantum computers are bigger, pricier, and consume much more power .  Rigetti's big customers include the Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems Center, the Air Force Research Lab, and the Horizon Quantum Computing in Singapore .  CoreWeave was founded as anEthereum-mining business in 2017, but abandoned that market after the cryptocurrency crash of 2018 . Analysts expect its revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 52% from $10.8 million to $37.7 million in 2024 . But with a market cap of $3.3 billion currently, Rigetti already trades at 87 times its estimated sales for 2027 .  CoreWeave bought Nvidia's H100 H100 GPUs for $100 million in 2022 . It then leveraged them as collateral to secure even more funding . It claims its dedicated GPU approach makes it roughly 35 times faster and cheaper for tackling AI tasks than traditional cloud platforms .  From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect CoreWeave's revenue to soar at a compound annual rate of 105% to $16.55 billion .

" The $3 trillion stock club isn't a big list; it's just Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple . Amazon is the fourth-largest company in the world, but it is currently valued at around $2.2 trillion . Apple lacks the growth to outperform Nvidia or Microsoft .  The bulk of Nvidia's revenue comes from its data center graphics processing units (GPUs), which have been widely deployed to train and run AI models . Nvidia has a dominant hold on this market, with most estimates stating that Nvidia's market share is greater than 90% .  Next quarter also looks promising for Nvidia, with revenue expected to rise 50% year over year . Part of this slowdown can be attributed to the U.S. government banning exports to China of its H20 chip . Demand for Nvidia's products is expected to persist, with data center buildouts expected to reach $1 trillion by 2028 .  Apple is barely growing and hasn't showcased the ability to release an innovative product for some time . Despite this, it still doesn't trade at much of a discount to the other two from a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio standpoint . With theS&P 500 trading at 22.4 times forward earnings, Apple could have a long way to fall before trading at that level .

" CoreWeave has emerged as a new favorite in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip stock arena . The company's infrastructure services business is thriving, and growth doesn't appear to be slowing down . However, valuation analysis suggests that the stock may be overbought .  Shares of CoreWeave have rocketed by 251% as of the closing bell on June 6 . The company went public back in March . McKinsey & Company recently reported that nearly $7 trillion could be allocated toward AI infrastructure spend over the next five years .  CoreWeave offers an infrastructure services business in which customers can access clusters of Nvidia GPUs among other architectures via the cloud . This is an interesting model, as it essentially allows generative AI developers an efficient way to access the industry's best hardware without needing to directly order it, wait for the chips to be manufactured .  Analysts expect CoreWeave to roughly triple its revenue over the next two years . The company's multiple continues to expand, leaving little room for error when it comes to an investment . But right now, the company is experiencing outsized levels of valuation expansion .

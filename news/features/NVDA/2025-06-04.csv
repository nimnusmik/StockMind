" Nvidia wrote down $4.5 billion on chips originally destined for customers in China that will go undelivered . The company had developed the chips to comply with Biden Administration regulations against sending technology to foreign adversaries that could help their AI efforts .  The H20 was built specifically for the China market under the old export rules . Because of the chip’s design and limited capabilities, it may be difficult to use in other countries . Some of the chips may “not meet the performance needs of customers in other regions”  Nvidia declined to comment beyond what its executives said during its earnings call last week . After China-based DeepSeek released its ChatGPT rival in January, major Chinese firms like Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencentpurchased Nvidia’s H20 chips .  Nvidia had initially expected to have to write off $5.5 billion of chip inventory from its balance sheet . But it managed to salvage about $1 billion of H20 inventory by “reusing] certain materials,” reducing the realized first-quarter writeoff to $4 .5 billion .  Nvidia reported first quarter revenue of $44.1 billion (up 69% year-over-year) Nvidia’s H20 chips are likely sitting in U.S.-friendly places like Taiwan .  Writing down the full value of the chips provides an immediate tax benefit by reducing the company’s taxable income . Manufacturing partners like TSMC and suppliers, includingSamsungand Micron, could be most impacted by the H20 inventory writeoff .  Trump’s new export ban prevents Nvidia from delivering chips to China for national security reasons . Nvidia could finally complete the H20 sales or deliver the chips to new customers in China, assuming the company holds onto H20 inventory .",negative,"nvidia, china, suppliers, alibaba, manufacturing"

" Intel's revenue is a cause of concern as in 2022, 2023, and 2024, it had declines in sales of 20.2%, 14%, and 2.1%, respectively . In the profitability side, the company went from a mid-30% net income range in 2019 to a 7.2% loss in 2024 . This reveals difficulties in pricing its products competitively and a massive capital expenditure related to manufacturing expansion .  On server side, performance benchmarks show that the new Granite Rapids platform outperforms the competition . This shows a much-needed technical upgrade from past versions, where they consistently fell behind AMD .  Intel's processors consume up to 38% more power than AMD's EPYC 9684X Genoa-X 2P processor . This is something Intel should improve, and investors should keep an eye on . Competition against NVIDIA is yet to be seen as the ecosystem for NVIDIA is now the most robust .  With the new tariffs implemented and the ever-increasing tensions, domestic production of high-performance chips is growing in importance . Taiwan, where TSMC is located, has been constantly under the risk of annexation by China and will be one of the first places to be invaded in a case of escalation . The US government has created the CHIPS Act, with $39 billion directed to semiconductor manufacturing projects .  Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy aims to restore manufacturing leadership while simultaneously building a foundry services business . AMD, Apple, and NVIDIA will use TSMC's plants in the US, Intel is building its own . This reduces costs, keeps earnings local, and avoids the risk of being overloaded with orders or plagiarizing technology .  Intel's balance sheet has deteriorated as the company funds its manufacturing transformation . Long-term debt increased substantially, from $33 billion in 2020 to over $46 billion by 2024 . The company's decision to cut its dividend by 66% in early 2023 signaled the financial pressure created by its capital-intensive strategy .  AMD has leveraged TSMC's manufacturing advantages to deliver superior performance per watt, increasing its server market share from single digits to 33% by Q1Y2024 . Nvidia with its GPUs being more efficient for AI applications, has completely dominated the AI accelerator market, with Intel's efforts in this high-growth segment .  Intel represents a high-risk, potentially high-reward investment proposition . With current levels of instability at an all-time high across most industries, the stock price presents a strong appeal . The current trade war can be a tailwind for the company and one of the few to come out of this with a positive experience .  An important strategy for this investment will be to look at the benchmarks for new products . There are aspects that need improvement and can predict sales .",negative,"intel, amd, processors, processor, nvidia"

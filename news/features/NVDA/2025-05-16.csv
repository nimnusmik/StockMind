" SoundHound AI Inc. has experienced a remarkable 20.7% surge in its stock price since reporting its first-quarter 2025 earnings last week . This uptick reflects growing investor confidence in the company's trajectory within the voice AI sector . Revenues of $29.1 million marked a staggering 151% increase year over year .  SoundHound reaffirmed its 2025 revenue guidance of $157 to $177 million . If achieved, this would represent a growth rate of approximately 85–109% over 2024 levels . However, despite strong revenue growth, gross margin has declined . This suggests operational efficiencies have not yet caught up with top-line expansion .  SoundHound’s stand-out quarterly revenue growth reflects momentum behind its enterprise AI solutions . The company activated more than 1,000 restaurant locations during the first quarter, nearly 10 times its pace a year ago . Its AI now handles around 10 million interactions per quarter across 13,000 restaurants .

" Nvidia is now one of the three largest companies in the world . The chip maker's control of the data center GPU market is estimated at around 90%. The AI revolution literally runs on these GPUs, and Nvidia's dominance gives it a front-row seat to AI's long-term growth .  Like any market, competition will eventually appear, giving huge upside potential to the AI stock below . Rival chipmakers like Intel and AMD have far lower market shares in data center GPUs, but also dramatically lower gross margins .  By the end of this decade, Amazon will have a higher market cap than Nvidia due to its Amazon Web Services division alone . The division has consistently been posting its highest profit margins in years . Right now, AWS is to cloud computing as Nvidia is to data center GPUs .  AWS has nearly as much market share in cloud infrastructure as its two nearest competitors combined . Some analysts believe that AWS alone could eventually be worth $3 trillion -- roughly Nvidia's current market cap . AWS will have the ability to buy cheaper chips from more manufacturers .

LLC Tal Liani; Analyst . At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded .  Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, Scott Herren, our CFO; and Mark Patterson, our Chief Strategy Officer. All comparisons will be made on a year-over-year basis. Please note that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements .  Q3 was another strong quarter for Cisco, with revenue, margins, and earnings per share all above the high end of our guidance ranges . We also generated solid growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations and subscription revenue .  The performance of our core business continues to produce strong cash flows, underpinning our commitment to deliver consistent capital returns . In Q3, we returned $3.1 billion in capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends .  Enterprise product orders were up 22% year-over-year in Q3, driven by double-digit growth in the Americas and APJC . Public sector orders grew 8% with growth in all geographies as governments continue to trust Cisco as their end-to-end technology partner .  Year-to-date orders for our industrial Internet of Things portfolio grew 35% year-over-year . We also saw triple-digit sequential growth in orders for Wi-Fi 7 portfolio in Q3 .  Orders we have received from web-scale customers were exceptionally strong in the quarter, exceeding $600 million . Year-to-date total to well over our $1 billion target for fiscal year 25 .  Saudi Arabia announced a new AI company, HUMAIN, and we will be a strategic technology partner contributing to their AI infrastructure build-outs . The partnership aligns with Saudi Vision 2030, contributing to the Kingdom's transformation .  Cisco has joined the AI infrastructure partnership with BlackRock Global Infrastructure Partners, MGX, Microsoft, NVIDIA, XAI and Energy Partners GE Renova and exterior energy as it seeks to invest in secure, efficient, and scalable infrastructure to support AI workloads .  Cisco 8-K, Silicon 1 optics and optical systems are being deployed by five of the six largest web scalers . With a genetic AI, the network is fundamentally constrained and will require ultrafast, low-latency, energy-efficient networks .  Our recently launched security products of Secure Access, XDR and Hypershield collectively added over 370 new customers in the quarter . This was also the largest deal ever for Splunk .  Agentic AI advancements for Cisco XDR and Splunk to simplify threat detection and response . A new partnership with ServiceNow, which will integrate their security operations capabilities with Cisco AI Defense . Foundation AI, a team of leading AI and security experts focused on developing cutting-edge technology to address the fundamental security issues of the AI era with novel open source tools .  Over 60% of support cases are touched by AI-driven automation, which is driving up the proportion of complex cases we can solve within one day . Scott has made the decision to retire at the end of fiscal year 2025 .  Mark Patterson, our current Chief Strategy Officer, will serve as Sysco's new Chief Financial Officer . In Mark's nearly 25 years at Cisco, he's held leadership roles in finance, strategy, and operations . Most recently, leading our corporate strategy, development and incubation organization .  Jeetu Patel promoted to President and Chief Product Officer . Kevin Will appointed to Cisco's Board of Directors to help accelerate growth in new role .  R. Scott Herren: For the quarter, total revenue was $14.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year . Non-GAAP net income was $3.8 billion and earnings per share was $0.96 .  Q3 product orders were up 20% year-over-year, excluding Splunk . Software revenue was up 25% at $5.6 billion, with software subscription revenue up 26% . Non-GAAP product gross margin was 67.6%, up 70 basis points driven by productivity improvements and Splunk, partially offset by pricing .  Non-GAAP operating margin at 34.5%, above the high end of our guidance range . Operating cash flow was $4.1 billion, up 2%, primarily driven by revenue and earnings growth . We returned $3.5 billion to shareholders during the quarter comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend .  During Q3, we closed the acquisition of SnapAttack, which adds capability to Splunk and helping organizations power the security operations center of the future . Our guide assumes current tariffs and exemptions remain in place through the quarter .  The size and scale of our supply chain provides us some unique advantages as we support our customers globally . We'll continue to leverage our world-class supply chain team to help mitigate the impact of tariffs on steel and aluminum and retaliatory tariffs .  For the full year fiscal '25, our guidance is -- we expect revenue to be in the range of $56.7 billion . Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.96 to $0 .98, and we're assuming a non-GAap effective tax rate of approximately 18%.  Charles Robbins: We haven't seen any meaningful change in how and they're purchasing . They're still committed to the technology transition. They're going to continue to spend until they just absolutely have to stop. And I think that as of right now, they're still comfortable. As it relates to pull forwards .  R. Scott Herren: We didn't motivate a lot of pull ahead by talking about price increases . We looked at channel inventory, which you would think would go up, was down . Channel inventory was down. Channel partners also didn't see any buy ahead or delay behavior .  Web scaler inventory on hand went down during the quarter . Meraki activations stayed right where it was, which is back in line with where it's pre pandemic .  Global Public Sector was up 8%, organic growth, it was up 3% globally . In the US, we saw strength in federal ironically. We saw a double-digit order growth in US Federal this quarter .  Charles Robbins: Overall, we were pleased with public sector during the quarter . Ahmed Sami Badri: Michelle, can we go to the next analyst? Tal Liani: We're seeing sovereign cloud strategies being built around the world .  R. Scott Herren: There's a significantly larger opportunity in enterprise AI, right, as they build out the capability to do inferencing inside their own data centers . Tal Tal: I think there's a -- in aggregate, the AI opportunity has several years to run at this point. Tal, just to remind you on the tail end of building out all the public cloud .  Charles Robbins: There's absolutely no orders in the $600 million from Saudi Arabia . We've been working with them on this for months and the short answer is there's no orders from them. They are just getting started .  HUMAIN CEO Tareq Amin was the CTO at Reliance Jio when we built that network with them over the course of several years . We've been doing large-scale projects with them for a dozen years now . So I think that's not included in any of our forecasts from our sales teams or anything at this point .  Customers are telling us that they -- if we could get more capacity out, they would buy more . And we've got a number of other chips that are in various stages of the process for the next-generation platforms that we're also looking forward to .  On the Middle East front, I will just tell you that Tareq made a comment to me that they're behind and they're going to catch up . So I think they're . going to spend a lot of money . It's hundreds of billions of dollars at the end of the day that they will be spending .  On the enterprise campus front, yes, we saw strong orders in campus switching . We saw the triple-digit sequential growth in orders for Wi-Fi 7. And I think there'll be as big as any of the major web scalers in the United States is how I would think about it .  The networking orders strength in the quarter was across the board, Charles Robbins said . Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator Michael Ng, Goldman Sachs.  Splunk is performing in line with or actually slightly ahead of our expectations on both revenue and profitability . We saw it in we saw strong growth in enterprise routing. growth in data center switching. We saw that triple-digit sequential growth in Wi-Fi 7.  The integration has gone really well. consistent with what we told you last quarter . The people side of integration is pretty much complete at this point across all functions . The product integration continues to go along well. And this is the quarter that we actually lapped the acquisition during Q3 . I don't really plan on breaking out organic versus inorganic from this point forward .  Charles Robbins: It's been the intent of these customers from day one to move away from InfiniBand . They feel very good about the technology and how it's enabling them to run these training models over native Ethernet or some enhanced Ethernet that we are delivering .  The real high-value pieces of this are the operating system and the silicon. components. And as many of them are transitioning hard into running their own proprietary operating systems on these platforms, it's imperative that you have silicon if you want to be competitive long term .  On the AI orders, how do you think about the growth? I would say just one thing to remember is that these are big customers that are -- and these orders are nonlinear in nature. So we'll see how it goes .  R. Scott Herren: ""We have to execute because if we miss with these customers, then we sit on the sidelines for a while"" Amit Patel: ""You're doing the math right on margins. The biggest difference you can see is actually in the gross margin line""  The full quarter of the tariffs being in effect, and we reflected the full cost without mitigation . Still feel good about putting up the midpoint of the guide at 11% EPS growth .  Charles Robbins: It's hard to say. We've also seen some strength over the last 12 months in the enterprise campus business . What's most important to our customers right now is that we embed security deep into the network .  R. Scott Herren: We're going to deploy security everywhere out through the network infrastructure. And that plus AI, I think, will give customers reasons to really look at these platforms. Yes. And Simon, on your second question on the impact of tariffs after July 9. I mentioned in our forecast that underpins the guide for Q4 an expectation that on July 9 .  It's a little bit hard right now to predict what is going to happen on July 9 and what agreements get put in place between now and then . So we've reflected that in the guide for Q4. with the two exemptions .  R. Scott Herren: Most of this AI infrastructure has not begun to flow through revenue yet . Charles Robbins: We said all along that we thought the $1 billion target out for the year was a sales target, not a revenue target .  The $600 million of AI orders tend to be nonlinear and they're very large customers . Could you give an estimate of roughly what you think the impact of tariffs are in your guidance for Q4 for gross margin? Charles Robbins: ""Yes, Andrew, I think you nailed it. You almost answered the question for us""  R. Scott Herren: I think it's fairly balanced. Three of the six that grew triple digits . I would tell you that we when I would look at these customers, we're seeing acceleration across all of them. So it's all positive, but there are -- in this case, we had three that were just super high growers next quarter .  Silicon One has an extended partnership with NVIDIA is an endorsement of your Silicon One family and underscores your opportunity as enterprises deploy AI compute . Charles Robbins: A lot of the solutions that we're going to deliver to the enterprise are still to be delivered .  We're definitely seeing acceleration, it's in the hundreds of millions of dollars, not in the billions yet that we're seeing . But again, there's a lot of dependence on the sales force flagging these things properly .  As soon as customers are asking for it, we'll be first in market ready to deliver it. and I think that's going to be driven by a combination of power benefit as well as speed requirements. We don't give out pipeline for AI at this point.  Charles Robbins: I don't think we've seen a meaningful share shift in white box spending . Oliver Tuszik was most recently running our Europe, Middle East, Africa region and before that was running our global partner organization .  R. Scott Herren: Of the $600 million in orders that we took during Q3, two thirds were systems as opposed to optics and optical . Ahmed Sami Badri: We're seeing the shift to systems that we predicted in the Q2 call .  Charles Robbins: I think the AI opportunity for us, we believe, is a strong one. We think we're well positioned. We play across the full stack. We have networking, security, Silicon, which I think are all very important. We also have secure AI solutions that we're delivering in the marketplace.  Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 results will be on Wednesday, August . I'm really proud of what they've done. We have a great team that are delivering right now, strong execution and great results. I look forward to talking to you soon.

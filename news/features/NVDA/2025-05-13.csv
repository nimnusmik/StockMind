" In this podcast, analysts Sanmeet Deo and Ricky Mulvey discuss Palantir's impressive business results and astonishing valuation . Cynthia Stewart, executive director of DART Collective, joins Motley Fool personal finance expert Robert Brokamp to discuss how AI is changing scams and how to protect yourself .  Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies . Apple, Netflix and Apple are among the companies you can invest in . The biggest story today is Palantir, which trades at 600 times trailing earnings .  Palantir is a company offering artificial intelligence platforms to the US federal government and private enterprises . CEO Alex Karp says the results of the company are absolutely incredible . Sanmeet Deo: ""I thought there was a ton of great growth here""  72% of Palantir's business is in the United States . Europe is not a huge portion of their business now. It could be a big opportunity for them for sure .  Ricky Mulvey: As an ASML shareholder, count me offended Sanmeet. Sanmeet, this is a software company that trades at more than 90 times sales. On that basis, it's the most expensive company in the NASDAQ with one exception, and that is Palantir .  The market is expecting revenue growth of 31% plus and EPS growth north of 70% . Palantir has a strong moot for its artificial intelligence platform, and maybe just maybe this is the next coming of NVIDIA .  Palantir has the potential to be a standard when it comes to AI, almost like an AI operating system of sorts for companies . The fundamentals are strong, 71% US commercial revenue growth, that's huge and they're gaining more commercial customers . Anecdotal evidence I've seen tells me that the company is expanding fast .  Ricky Mulvey: While it's tough with the valuation, that's really the only thing that holds me back from buying more of this thing . International sales up more than 40% but this former growth darling is posting overall sales declines in North America .  Celsius's SG&A costs were up about 21% while revenues were down 7% for the quarter . Sanmeet Deo: ""I was pretty disappointed by this quarter as well. I'm a huge fan of the company and the drink too""  Ricky Mulvey: Maybe this goes against the health promise that it offers, but it needs a mixed drink . Sanmeet Deo: ""There's a lot of reasons to be pessimistic. They've cited that tailwinds are coming, and let's see in the next couple of quarters if they're true to their word""  The more pessimistic take is that here is a company struggling to find growth within its core product, and now it is maybe overpaying for growth by acquiring another brand in order to become a growth story again . Ricky Mulvey: The positive spin is that this makes sense for their category. It's a healthy ish energy drink that fits well within their portfolio of brands .  Sanmeet Deo: I'd like to see more like synergies where it comes to will Alani Nu's growth be able to help bring that Celsius core brand growth up . Ricky Mulvey: If you have an open line of communication to CEO John Fieldly, he's still telling investors a growth story .  Sanmeet Deo: Do you think it's time for Celsius maybe to settle down into a more mature place? Sanmeet: It's a little early to call itself a cash cow story at this point . Ricky Mulvey: We'll wrap up with DoorDash, which also reported swinging to a net income profit .  DoorDash was heavily used during COVID, but the habit is stuck . Ricky Mulvey: The convenience and reliability of DoorDash has stuck, and more and more people are using it .  Sanmeet Deo: With Deliveroo, they're expanding into their geographic reach, getting nine new markets in UK, Europe, Middle East, Singapore . I think they're really trying to take on Uber Eats and Just Takeaway. Those are the ones that have that customer stickiness that habit that's formed by using them. Just from my own personal experience, I now tend to go to DoorDash more than I go to doorDash.  I think they're really taking an aggressive push to scale and compete hard with the likes of Uber Eats and others . The SevenRooms acquisition, though, yeah, that makes a little less sense to me .  Cynthia Stewart is the executive director and founder of DART, a nonprofit that uses gamification to help people recognize online scammers . She joined Robert Brokamp to discuss which scams are on the rise and how to protect yourself .  The FBI just put out this year's Internet crime report . Fake cryptocurrency investments, tech support scams and romance scams would be your top three . If you go by number of victims, fishing is always number one and then tech support and then extortion .  Robert Brokamp: I think crypto is the new gift cards . People have learned not to buy gift cards, but now they can just send them to the crypto ATM and their money is just as gone .  People can impersonate people who are not strangers very quickly, often using AI to impersonate voices or just gathering information about you from social media, Facebook, TikTok . Don't let anybody rush you by making you feel some sort of way .  The next time there's some a disaster or one of us is in trouble and we need help, how are we going to confirm that we are talking to the person we think we're talking to? If you have a plan, a code word or some way you're going to acknowledge each other, it stops scammers from being able to rip you off .  Cynthia Stewart: Talking about it is a huge thing, especially talk about it with the older adults in your life . Robert Brokamp: In our family, our kids knew to use terms related to Star Wars as the code words .  There are tools that can help flag potential scam calls that can filter those out . Older adults may need help installing those sorts of things on their devices .  Robert Brokamp: People need to know what they can do safely, it is always safe to look at your email and text messages . On the other hand, you're trying to keep them safe, he says .  Report it to the FBI or the FTC . Cynthia Stewart: Change your passwords right away . Ricky Mulvey: Even if you don't think it will benefit you, it's still worth reporting .

Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies . Apple, Netflix and Apple are among the companies you can invest in . The biggest story today is Palantir, which trades at 600 times trailing earnings .  Palantir is a company offering artificial intelligence platforms to the US federal government and private enterprises . CEO Alex Karp says the results of the company are absolutely incredible . Sanmeet Deo: ""I thought there was a ton of great growth here""  72% of Palantir's business is in the United States . Europe is not a huge portion of their business now. It could be a big opportunity for them for sure .  Ricky Mulvey: As an ASML shareholder, count me offended Sanmeet. Sanmeet, this is a software company that trades at more than 90 times sales. On that basis, it's the most expensive company in the NASDAQ with one exception, and that is Palantir .  The market is expecting revenue growth of 31% plus and EPS growth north of 70% . Palantir has a strong moot for its artificial intelligence platform, and maybe just maybe this is the next coming of NVIDIA .  Palantir has the potential to be a standard when it comes to AI, almost like an AI operating system of sorts for companies . The fundamentals are strong, 71% US commercial revenue growth, that's huge and they're gaining more commercial customers . Anecdotal evidence I've seen tells me that the company is expanding fast .  Ricky Mulvey: While it's tough with the valuation, that's really the only thing that holds me back from buying more of this thing . International sales up more than 40% but this former growth darling is posting overall sales declines in North America .  Celsius's SG&A costs were up about 21% while revenues were down 7% for the quarter . Sanmeet Deo: ""I was pretty disappointed by this quarter as well. I'm a huge fan of the company and the drink too""  Ricky Mulvey: Maybe this goes against the health promise that it offers, but it needs a mixed drink . Sanmeet Deo: ""There's a lot of reasons to be pessimistic. They've cited that tailwinds are coming, and let's see in the next couple of quarters if they're true to their word""  The more pessimistic take is that here is a company struggling to find growth within its core product, and now it is maybe overpaying for growth by acquiring another brand in order to become a growth story again . Ricky Mulvey: The positive spin is that this makes sense for their category. It's a healthy ish energy drink that fits well within their portfolio of brands .  Sanmeet Deo: I'd like to see more like synergies where it comes to will Alani Nu's growth be able to help bring that Celsius core brand growth up . Ricky Mulvey: If you have an open line of communication to CEO John Fieldly, he's still telling investors a growth story .  Sanmeet Deo: Do you think it's time for Celsius maybe to settle down into a more mature place? Sanmeet: It's a little early to call itself a cash cow story at this point . Ricky Mulvey: We'll wrap up with DoorDash, which also reported swinging to a net income profit .  DoorDash was heavily used during COVID, but the habit is stuck . Ricky Mulvey: The convenience and reliability of DoorDash has stuck, and more and more people are using it .  Sanmeet Deo: With Deliveroo, they're expanding into their geographic reach, getting nine new markets in UK, Europe, Middle East, Singapore . I think they're really trying to take on Uber Eats and Just Takeaway. Those are the ones that have that customer stickiness that habit that's formed by using them. Just from my own personal experience, I now tend to go to DoorDash more than I go to doorDash.  I think they're really taking an aggressive push to scale and compete hard with the likes of Uber Eats and others . The SevenRooms acquisition, though, yeah, that makes a little less sense to me .

People have learned not to buy gift cards, but now they can just send them to the crypto ATM and their money is just as gone .  People can impersonate people who are not strangers very quickly, often using AI to impersonate voices or just gathering information about you from social media, Facebook, TikTok . Don't let anybody rush you by making you feel some sort of way .

If you have a plan, a code word or some way you're going to acknowledge each other, it stops scammers from being able to rip you off .  Cynthia Stewart: Talking about it is a huge thing, especially talk about it with the older adults in your life . Robert Brokamp: In our family, our kids knew to use terms related to Star Wars as the code words .  There are tools that can help flag potential scam calls that can filter those out . Older adults may need help installing those sorts of things on their devices .

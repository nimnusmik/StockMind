" Data center company Applied Digital announced two 15-year lease agreements with CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure company . The news sent Coreweave’s stock soaring by more than 40% over the next few days . Such double digit percentage gains have become par for the course during CoreWeaves' brief life as a publicly traded stock .  Of the 19 analysts who cover the company, just three had a “buy” rating on the stock . The consensus rating is firmly “hold” as of June 6 . Some analysts believe the demand for the stock is being driven by retail investors .  Investors are looking for ways to capitalize on the success of OpenAI, which is privately held, and see CoreWeave as one of the few vehicles for exposure in the public markets . OpenAI signed a multi-billion dealas its cloud infrastructure provider until April 2029 . Nvidia, currently the most valuable company in the worldby market cap, is also an investor in the company .  CoreWeave posted revenue of $981.6 million in the first three months of the year, up 420% from the year-ago period . Founded in 2017 by three commodity traders, Coreweave began as an ethereum mining company . In 2019 it pivoted to cloud infrastructure to enhance GPU capabilities .  Short squeeze situationsimilar to the GameStopone that rocked markets in 2021 by causing the stock to go from $17 to $483 over the course of a month . The volatility of the CoreWeave in this instance is amplified by its low float . Short interest is approximately 8.44% of the company's float, well above the 2% to 5% average across U.S. stocks .  Microsoft accounted for over 70% of CoreWeave’s revenue last quarter . The company has a 387% debt-to-equity ratio, -38.7% profit margin and $11.9 billion debt with just $1.28 billion in cash .  CoreWeave’s debt obligations have, in-part, led D.A. Davidson Head of Research Gil Luria to rate the stock as an underperformer . The lockup period on the IPO expires in September and restricted shareholders can offload their CoreWeaves holdings and the stock price will drop .  is that the AI company will continue to leave believers, and skeptics, scratching their heads .

" Nvidia (NVDA) once again proved to the markets, after reporting its Q1 earnings, that it remains the undisputed leader powering the globalAIrevolution . Nvidia stock experienced a strong post-earnings surge, even if the momentum cooled slightly in the days that followed .  Nvidia reported revenue of $44 billion, beating its own guidance of $43 billion . Gross margins, which had been a point of concern during the early stages of Blackwell’s rollout, came in at 71.3% . Nvidia is projecting $45 billion in revenue, with a margin of plus or minus 2% .  Nvidia shares jumped more than 5% in after-hours trading following the earnings release . The company continues to state that once production is fully ramped, margins could move into the 70–80% range over the next few quarters . The muted post-earnings reaction is actually a positive sign, it shows the market didn’t see enough red .  Q1 revenue jumped nearly 70% year-over-year, but sequential growth was just 12% . For a company priced for hypergrowth, this kind of slowdown can be an early warning signal . The U.S. export restrictions on AI chips like the H20 led to a $4.5 billion write-down and forced Nvidia to walk away from $15 billion in potential sales to China .  Q1 would have been the first quarter since the AI boom began in which Nvidia did not achieve sequential growth . For a stock valued for perfection, even a modest slowdown can pose a valuation risk . The company continues to stand out as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) opportunity .  Nvidia trades at 31.6x forward earnings, with a consensus growth rate of 29% CAGR over the next three to five years . This results in a PEG ratio of just 1x—virtually identical to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), despite AMD’s significantly slower growth outlook, and significantly lower than most of the other Magnificent 7 names . Not a single analyst rates NVDA stock as aSell.  Nvidia crushed its own guidance and delivered a Q2 forecast that dispels doubts about how quickly gross margins are recovering . While risks like evolving U.S. sanctions on China, Nvidia’s ability to maintain its presence in that market, and rising local competition are worth keeping an eye on .",positive,"nvidia, earnings, revenue, nvda, stock"

The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years . When you're ready to invest, check out this top 10 list of stocks to buy .  Stocks rocket higher in May . The Nasdaq is up more than 25% from those April lows . The S&Prose 6% in May and is now within 4% of its all time February high . Don't miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you joinStock Advisor .  The number of companies that were able to confidently project out their outlook for the next quarter or even 2025, I felt like I could count them on one hand this quarter . The market's gotten really used to these wild swings of panic from, this is going to be the worst potential trade outcomes to euphoria over, maybe this is the not so worst outcome . I think investors, from my perspective, they should keep investing but be rational here .  The individual investor has become less bearish over time, and that's actually a contrary indicator . The lower that goes, the more euphoric your average investor gets because it means that there's more capital tied into stocks relative to cash on the sidelines . I think it's time to think about a little bit more selective securities like, the likes of a booking .  When the market is getting a little too complacent, that might be time to look at stocks which have lower trading multiples . Andy Cross: Those ones that are really cash heavy that sell them a little bit more reasonable, even like a company likeMicrosoft, it is so ingrained .  Zscaler jumped nearly 10% on Friday after reporting healthy fiscal third quarter earnings that included a third straight quarter of 23% growth in annual recurring revenue . Asit Sharma: ""Zscaler isn't going to stop growing, so this isn't really two years' worth of revenue""  Zscaler has created highly effective AI agents, for one thing, to help companies deal with security operations tasks . It comes to mind that the business which was built around this zero trust architecture really played well and plays well in an age of AI threats .  The strength and ongoing business is underpinned by AI demand, says Andy Cross . Jay Chaudhry who's the founder, the CEO, major shareholder in the business continues to drive it forward .  New sales director Mike Rich, who came over from service now, and so, which also has some consumption based usage systems and pricing mechanisms in their own products . I like how they're innovating both on the product side and really driving this sales side . Revenues, they expect to be up 23% for this fiscal year . The one thing to watch, I think, is $1 based retention rate fell a little bit .  Asit Sharma: Jay Chaudhry is someone who pushes on a lot of fronts, and that's what you want in a CEO . Sharma: I like the fact that they continue to innovate on the product side, as well as the sales side .  Traditionally, Zscaler sign up companies for years on specific modules . If you wanted to change anything, Andy Cross says, you had to go through a new procurement process filled with negotiations . Nobody wanted to do that, it's complex .  This is a company that if it wanted to, could be turning a GAAP profit right now . They tend to work at break even GAAP margins to slight losses, and it's not because the company's not growing . Jay Chaudhry and his team not afraid to spend on R&D, to bump that expense up .  Asit Sharma: I think if you're a holder of this company, you have much more reason to feel confident after the last few quarters than perhaps this time last year . But I'm not so sure I'm a buyer at this point . Sharma: The trading multiples feel a little inflated to me .  Andy Cross: I think they'll do about $3 billion in that ARR this year . At this multiple, after the performance has been so strong, I think I'm willing to just just sit back. I own it. I'm completely comfortable holding it. Not really eager to jump in, but if I see it pull back, this quarter was very impressive .  Comps are up 2.9%, driven by 2.3% increase in average ticket size . Asit Sharma: ""The strength of Ulta's model has been obscured over the last year or so""  Beauty tends to be very resilient, says Andy Cross . Beauty not so much of a discretionary item for a certain set of people, but almost as a staple that you are going to continue to buy it . But at the same time, Kecia said that they're very cautious about value .  Ulta Beauty and Leashed Initiative is going to drive core growth scale into new business lines, streamline cost structures . Asit Sharma: I think Ulta is excelling. They are making investments. They're seeing some cost pressure on the employees side. But I think with the scale they have, it's actually good investment .  The outlook for this company for the rest of the year is decreasing. I think comparable sales are going to land between 0%-1% for the entire fiscal year. Why did the stock react the way it did? I think it's the taking of market share, but also seeing that the plan for new stores continues .  The beauty and cosmetics sector has been making a comeback in recent years . As dust settles around the whole beauty sector, I think folks will be looking to concentrate capital into just a few high quality names . This is another high quality beauty company .  Only about 1% of Ulta's merchandise is direct import . The rest is partnering with their brands . Andy Cross: There's some questions about where's the pricing going to fall .  Ulta is pretty good at that, but the risk is a little higher of tariffs than the company presented it . The discussion didn't center enough around, what's the impact if we get on, the cosmetics level I know, 15% higher prices later this year . I don't know if we'll see that much, but to me, that's a risk .  The one thing about Ulta that I think they have shown very much like other big box retailers is that scale . They repurchased 986,000 shares at about $363 per share . The stock right now is at 473, so that quarterly investment has been good for shareholders .  Going forward, looking at a company that's trading close to 20 times its next 12 months earnings per share, I feel that it's good . Maybe you're not getting a bargain basement price, especially after being up 10%. This is retail, after all. This is never going to grow as quickly as a Zscaler. On the other hand, I don't think it's a bad price here .  Asit Sharma: ""I'd be a buyer of Ulta, even after a little bit this ramp, but don't be greedy. Just nibble"" Cross: ""If somebody wants to nibble on that, that's fine. I bought some earlier this year, so I'm pretty happy"" Sharma: I'm looking for you to go back and store and make my nibble worth it .  Asit Sharma and Andy Cross: The Motley Fool Money team discuss the market experiences of Zscaler and e.l.f. Beauty .

" By one forecast, artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a $15.7 trillion boost to the worldwide economy come 2030 . Nvidia became the world's largest publicly traded company because of its AI-graphics processing unit (GPU) dominance, exceptional pricing power, and industry-leading innovation .  No company has been a more-direct beneficiary of the AI revolution than semiconductor titan Nvidia . Analysts at PwC believe it'll add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade . Nvidia has always been a key provider of graphics processing units used for gaming and cryptocurrency mining .  Nvidia has been a clear beneficiary of demand for AI-GPUs outpacing their supply . CEO Jensen Huang has set out an ambitious goal of bringing a new AI- GPU to market each year .  Nvidia was commanding more than $40,000 for its Hopper chips, which is notably higher than the $10,000 to $15,000 price tag direct rival Advanced Micro Devices was assigning to its Instinct AI-accelerating chips . Nvidia's CUDA software platform has been indispensable, as well .  Over the last 54 months, 170 separate Form 4s have been filed with the SEC outlining sales from company executive and directors . Dec. 3, 2020 is the last time any Nvidia insider has purchased shares of their company . On a cumulative basis over the trailing-four-year period, insiders have dumped more than $3.35 billion worth of Nvidia stock .  A complete absence of insider buying, coupled with a steady stream of insider selling (especially in the summer of 2024), points to a potential top for Nvidia shares . Competitive pressures have been and will continue to weigh on Nvidia's gross margin .  It's not yet clear if Nvidia's aggressive innovation schedule is going to help or hinder its sales . The bigger concern is what future demand might look like for Nvidia's hardware . Nvidia hasn't been getting much help on the regulatory front, either .  Every game-changing innovation has endured an early inning bubble-bursting event . Most businesses aren't anywhere close to optimizing their Ai solutions, or generating a positive return on their AI investments .

Nvidia stock turned a $1,000 investment into a whopping $18,600 over this five-year period . Jensen Huang, who co-founded the company in 1993, turned 62 in February .

Nvidia's data center market platform's growth has been phenomenal over this same period . In fiscal 2020, gaming was Nvidia's largest platform, accounting for 51% of its total revenue . Nvidia's grip on this market -- which is growing like wildfire -- remains tight .  In March 2020, I wrote: ""In 2025, fully autonomous vehicles should be legal -- or very close to being so -- across the United States. Nvidia is well positioned to majorly profit from [this event]."" This event seems at least a few years away, but I continue to believe it will ""turbocharge"" Nvidia's growth thanks to its widely adopted AI-powered DRIVE platform .  Nvidia has launched a number of major new technologies that have likely taken most investors and Wall Street analysts by surprise . One example is its Omniverse platform, which enables the creation of virtual worlds and digital twins . It's been widely adopted by a broad industry range of large enterprise companies -- including Amazon, PepsiCo, and BMW Group .

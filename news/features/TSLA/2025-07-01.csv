" Rep. Jason Smith: ""Nobody asked for the IRS to be Americans' tax preparer, filer, and auditor"" Despite Smith’s remarks, the Direct File program has receivedbroad support from taxpayers and voters across the political spectrum .  The IRS launched Direct File using Inflation Reduction Act funds . It started as a pilot in 12 states during the 2024 tax season and expanded to 25 states in 2025 . 90% of surveyed users rated their experience as excellent or above average .  The Trump administration plans to discontinue Direct File for the 2026 tax season . Staff working on the program were reportedly told weeks earlier that they would no longer be needed . The Department of Government Efficiency, once led by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, reportedly played a role in weakening the program .  Many policy advocates and voters say Direct File filled a real need and made tax season less stressful . “The IRS created Direct File without congressional approval,” Williamswrotein April .  Congressman says 'Nobody Asked For The IRS To Be Americans' Tax Preparer' Applauds Efforts to Shut Down The IRS Direct File Program .",neutral,"irs, tax, direct, taxpayers, congressional"

" The bill has grown by nearly $1 trillion since the Senate took it up . The energy provisions of the bill have come under particular scrutiny after last-minute changes phased out clean energy tax credits faster than expected and added new taxes on wind and solar projects .  New last-minute inducements were unveiled for fossil fuels, including one classifying coal as a critical mineral when it comes to a government manufacturing credit . The mix left fossil fuel advocates celebrating and clean energy advocates slamming the bill at a new, higher volume .  Trump suggested Republicans look past the deficit implications, urging passage as soon as possible . He also made a case that White House projections of blockbuster economic growth — dismissed by many economists as fantastical — will make the math add up in the end .  The Senate version of the bill would eliminate government help for renewable energy projects . It would also add a new cost for wind and solar projects completed after 2027 if a certain amount of supplies came from China . The changes stunned many clean energy advocates, not just Musk .  Senate Republicans say the bill will generate over $15 billion in new federal revenue through expanded oil, gas, and coal leasing . Fossil fuels advocates were largely ebullient at the last-minute changes, which saw existing fossil-fuel-focused provisions around issues like permitting, lease sales, and methane emissions fees . The bill is also set to be even more expensive after weeks of negotiations .  Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projects $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034 . 11.8 million additional Americans would become uninsured by 2034 because of healthcare provisions . The bill is projected to be even more expensive after things like interest costs are included .  Two GOP senators already likely to vote no and others not yet saying if they will back Trump's effort to get this over the line . The bill will also need to be approved by the House if it advances and is then considered by a bloc of fiscal conservatives there .",neutral,"renewable, fuels, energy, coal, fuel"

" The bill has grown by nearly $1 trillion since the Senate took it up . The energy provisions of the bill have come under particular scrutiny after last-minute changes phased out clean energy tax credits faster than expected and added new taxes on wind and solar projects .  New last-minute inducements were unveiled for fossil fuels, including one classifying coal as a critical mineral when it comes to a government manufacturing credit . The mix left fossil fuel advocates celebrating and clean energy advocates slamming the bill at a new, higher volume .  Trump suggested Republicans look past the deficit implications, urging passage as soon as possible . He also made a case that White House projections of blockbuster economic growth — dismissed by many economists as fantastical — will make the math add up in the end .  The Senate version of the bill would eliminate government help for renewable energy projects . It would also add a new cost for wind and solar projects completed after 2027 if a certain amount of supplies came from China . The changes stunned many clean energy advocates, not just Musk .  Senate Republicans say the bill will generate over $15 billion in new federal revenue through expanded oil, gas, and coal leasing . Fossil fuels advocates were largely ebullient at the last-minute changes, which saw existing fossil-fuel-focused provisions around issues like permitting, lease sales, and methane emissions fees . The bill is also set to be even more expensive after weeks of negotiations .  Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projects $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034 . 11.8 million additional Americans would become uninsured by 2034 because of healthcare provisions . The bill is projected to be even more expensive after things like interest costs are included .  Two GOP senators already likely to vote no and others not yet saying if they will back Trump's effort to get this over the line . The bill will also need to be approved by the House if it advances and is then considered by a bloc of fiscal conservatives there .",neutral,"renewable, fuels, energy, coal, fuel"

Tesla is expected to publish second-quarter global production and delivery figures that show a 14% decline in deliveries to 383,000 vehicles .

" Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia are turning AI investments into concrete results . Artificial intelligence has helped these companies grow their profit margins . All three stocks sport reasonable valuations despite being around all-time highs .  The longer users stay on Meta's Family of Apps, the more attractive those platforms become for advertisers . Microsoft has integrated AI across its Microsoft 365 suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, etc.) through an AI feature called Copilot .  Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia all have multiple ways to grow earnings . Nvidia is the undisputed leader in providing a full stack of AI computing solutions . Meta has steadily increased its advertising revenue and profitability .  Nvidia's sky-high operating margins have helped the company convert a substantial amount of revenue into profit . But competition or a slowdown in AI spending may lead to margin erosion over time . Nvidia has transformed its business from relying largely on gaming, professional visualization, cryptocurrency, and other end markets to being a data center-focused business .  Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia all sport surprisingly reasonable valuations . Most of the Magnificent Seven have forward price-to-earnings ratios in the mid-20s to mid-30s . Nvidia's 51.7% profit margin means that it converts over half of every dollar in sales into pure net income .  Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia stand out as long-term winners due to their established and industry-leading business models . However, these stocks are not cheap . A growth slowdown could make any of these stocks appear more expensive in the near term .  The Motley Fool is issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies .

" Investors are rewarding big tech companies that are monetizing AI . Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet could be coiled springs for long-term growth . Investors may be souring onTesla,Apple, andAlphabet due to their apparent lack of AI achievements .  Tesla stock popped after its robotaxi event showcased progress on self-driving cars . Tesla could benefit from AI one day, but it isn't monetizing it to a significant extent right now . Apple hasn't made meaningful AI improvements to its product suite .  AI presents arguably the best opportunity in decades for competition to tap into Apple's dominant smartphone market share . Apple has grown increasingly dependent on sales outside the U.S., but has been losing market share in key markets like China due to intense competition from companies like Xiaomi, Huawei, and Vivo .  Alphabet-owned generative AI model Gemini can work with text, audio, visuals, video, and even code . Google Search is facing its biggest challenge in decades from competitors' AI-powered search offerings . The elephant in the room is uncertainty about how AI could affect Google Search .  Tesla is arguably the highest-risk name given its lofty valuation . But Apple and Alphabet both have more reasonable valuations (31.2 P/E for Apple and 18.6 for Alphabet) These companies generate a ton of free cash flow and earnings that they can use to reinvest in the business .  Short-term-minded investors may pass on Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet simply because they aren't proven AI plays . But all three stocks could still be worth buying and holding for long-term investors . Apple and Alphabet present far more compelling risk and potential reward profiles than Tesla .

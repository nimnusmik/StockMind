" Tesla is anything but a boring stock, I’ll give it that, but it is also tremendously overpriced . Tesla Inc.’s reaction to these headlines has been nothing short of unstable, explosive and precarious . As a result, there is a big picture about Tesla that many are missing .  Back then, quick EV adoption appeared inevitable, Tesla had the technological lead and the overwhelming market share lead in EVs . But a great deal has changed since, and investors are no longer excited about their automotive manufacturing business .  In June 2022, the investment community expected Tesla to mint more than 3.6 million units of sales in 2025 . Today, those expectations are down 45%. Price cuts have driven Tesla’s average selling prices down by roughly 45% . Even the flagship Models 3 and Y have been disappointing, and the Cybertruck has been a disaster .  Expectations for total Tesla 2025 automotive revenues are down almost 60% in this short period . And how has Tesla stock reacted to plunging expectations for revenues and earnings? It’s up . Chalk it up to “thesis drift”  Tesla bulls, three years ago believed in an EV future where Tesla would become the Apple AAPL of automakers, and everyone else would become Nokia, Blackberry or Motorola . Now they don't even care about Tesla’s auto business .  At $320 per share, Tesla is trading at an EV/sales of nearly 12x, a 2025 P/E of over 170x, and sporting a $1 trillion market cap . The value of the automotive business within Tesla not only represents a small portion of its current market cap — but is worth much less than even we expected a few years ago .  Tesla’s skunkworks — because that is clearly what is driving the share price and market cap . In auto-land, the average P/E for Ford, BMW, Mercedes XE:MBG, GM GM, Renault FR:RNO and Stellantis STLA is 6.5x . If we assume the Tesla automotive business — despite all the deteriorating metrics mentioned above — is a better business and deserving of a higher multiple than each of them, perhaps we can say it should be worth a 10x . Maybe we could even say 15x. And at a 2025 P /E of 15x, Tesla  The market already values Tesla’s FSD, robotaxis, Optimus and the energy business at roughly $1 trillion . Even if the automotive business were worthtwicethat amount (a P/E of 30x), the “Musk option” would be valued at $900 billion .  In our view, demand may not be as high as some think, some think . Even if people ultimately do want to have an autonomous vehicle, this isn’t months or years from now for the majority of drivers . We’ll need to discount future prospects back to the present .  Will we all want to subscribe to an autonomous-driving software vendor like we do with Apple or Android and our phones? Or will competition eventually force autonomous to be standard for all cars, like cruise control? How much will that cost? We're guessing that the price is somewhere between free and expensive .

" Dallas-based startup Zevo has raised $6 million in funding . It is a peer-to-peer car-sharing platform that focuses on electric vehicles . The company is already tracking over $8 million in annual recurring revenue .  90% of people using Zevo to rent an EV are doing so to ferry passengers on Uber or Lyft, or make DoorDash deliveries . On the renter side, an overwhelming portion of that interest is coming from gig workers, Sher said . Sher: ""We very intentionally raised private capital. We rejected VC capital for that reason""  Zevo is able to send more money to the vehicle owners than they’d get on platforms like Turo . Sher also talked up the service’s “contactless” process, which allows owners and renters to share a car without having to hand over keys .  Zevo is seeing a median rental of around 80 days . Hosts can make back between 35% and 65% of the cost of their car in just a year . Since 90% of vehicles on the platform are Teslas, that has Sher feeling pretty confident that he's been able to deliver on Musk’s promise from 2019 .  Sher says Zevo is laser-focused on disrupting car-sharing, and doesn't want to mess with the ride-hailing piece that Tesla is after . Sher says the company can break $100 million ARR with a staff of just 30 people and minimal future investment .",neutral,"uber, zevo, tesla, teslas, renters"

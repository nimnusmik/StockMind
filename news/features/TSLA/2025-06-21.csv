" Tesla has filed a federal lawsuit against former engineerZhongjie ""Jay"" Li, alleging he stole trade secrets tied to the company's ambitiousOptimushumanoid robot program . The lawsuit claims Li downloaded proprietary data related to Optimus’s robotic hand systems just before leaving Tesla in September .  Tesla says robot hands are strikingly similar to its Optimus designs . Optimus is Tesla's long-term bet on integrating robots into both industrial and personal environments . ""Defendants took a shortcut: theft,"" the company says in the lawsuit .  Optimus runs into the billions, and each step of progress requires extensive research, testing, and capital . Tesla's filing includes an internal email from last August warning employees that company devices and accounts were monitored .  Tesla's legal team characterized the alleged behavior as a calculated attempt to exploit corporate investments and engineering breakthroughs for personal commercial gain .

" Tesla (TSLA) remains one of the most important and influential stocks in the market . Its market capitalization of more than $1 trillion means that wherever it trends, so go many passive investors' portfolios . Much of the stock's recent rise can be tied to the firm's latest ambitions around autonomous driving, robotics and artificial .  Analysts from Baird and Argus Research each recently downgraded TSLA stock . Baird analysts Ben Kallo and Davis Sunderland noted that Tesla investors' enthusiasm over what's expected to be a high-profile robotaxi launch may be exaggerated . Baird put a $320 price target on Tesla, which suggests that the stock (trading above that price target currently) could be a stagnant holding at best over the next year .  Argus Research analyst Bill Selesky downgraded Tesla stock to a “Hold” rating, suggesting that non-fundamental factors have been unsustainably taking TSLA stock higher . That's a far cry from CEO Elon Musk's previous claims that only around 6,000 robotaxis are likely to hit the roads by the end of next year .  Tesla stock is one heck of a pricy automaker when grouped with its larger global peers . Wall Street analysts appear to be trending in the same direction as Argus and Baird . These multiples reflect some serious margin improvement due to non-EV related business lines .  At a trillion-dollar valuation, a surge to the $500 level would imply Tesla breaking back into the top 10 companies by market capitalization . But given the direction of other “Magnificent Seven” stocks, it's hard to envision Tesla once again nearing the top of the market cap leaderboard .

" Tesla is slated to begin testing a dozen of what it calls robotaxis for paying customers on Sunday in a limited area of Austin, Texas . A new law will require several checks before autonomous vehicles can be deployed without a human in the driver's seat .  The law will require companies to secure approval from the state motor vehicles department to operate autonomous cars with passengers . That approval would depend on sufficient proof that the cars won't pose a high risk to others if the self-driving system breaks down . Companies would also have to file detailed plans for how first responders should handle the cars if there is a problem, such as an accident .  A failure would likely be highly damaging to the company's stock, which has already tumbled 20% this year .

" Motley Fool analysts David Meier and Jason Moser join host Ricky Mulvey to discuss: Earnings from CrowdStrike,Lululemon, andBroadcom . Stacey Vanek Smith, co-host ofEverybody's Business, joins Ricky for a look at the tough job market facing college grads .  Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies . Nvidia:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009,you’d have $377,293!* Apple: If you invested . $37,319!* Netflix: $659,171!  The unemployment rate stands at 4.2%, while jobs were added above estimates . The US added almost 100,000 fewer jobs than estimates thought in the prior two months . Jason Moser: ""We're not close to teetering into a recession it would appear""  Ricky Mulvey: It's going to be interesting to see how the Fed reacts to this in the back half of the year . The odds of a recession this year are at 27%, something that remains surprising to me, since we are coming off a quarter of economic contraction .  This is a very confusing economic time for any observer . We'll dive into some jobs trends, tariffs, the economy with Bloomberg's Stacey Vanek Smith later in the show . We're going to focus on the business .  CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz is excited about the necessity agentic AI is creating for CrowdStrike holding Inc's AI native security . AI agents by customers of CrowdStrike, they actually create threat vectors for bad actors, David Meier says .  CrowdStrike has authorized one billion dollars for share buybacks . This is also a company that likes to issue a lot of stock, and it makes sense . David Meier: Cybersecurity is the only business that gets worse every single year in technology .  CrowdStrike more than doubled since outage, but there has to be plenty of things for CrowdStrike to be investing in going forward . Ricky Mulvey: For those listening, you have a few options when you have that extra cash, you can keep that cash on the balance sheet or what's wrong with a special dividend?  Lululemon is exposed to this tariff environment like most others in its space . 35% of fabrics originated from Taiwan, 28% from China mainland, and 11% from South Korea . The raw materials that they use, things like content labels, elastics, buttons, clasps, draw cords, all originates from Asia Pacific .  Lululemon has gotten absolutely crushed. It's at basically a grocery store earnings multiple, which, to me, says, no growth is ever coming again for this company . China revenue is up 22% versus the Americas up only 2% .  At around 18 times full-year earnings estimates, that's low, historically speaking . However, it also is because essentially it's pricing and no earnings growth this year . David Meier: If you think the company can return back to modest top-line growth and really bringing it down to the bottom line for more robust earnings growth, then today would make a lot of sense as a potential buying opportunity .  After the break, it's the rumble between President Trump, Elon Musk, in the impact on Tesla . Ricky Mulvey: What we've learned this week is that some friendships don't last forever . If you want the receipts of their beef, check out X and Truth Social .  The bill essentially eliminates a credit worth as much as $7,500 for buyers of certain Tesla models and other EVs by the end of the year . That would translate to roughly 1.2 billion dollar hit to Tesla's full year profit .  Tesla is in a very weird spot right now . Ricky Mulvey: Once you start accusing the president of being on certain lists and threatening to release those lists, I would guess that he is not going to take your calls anymore .  David Meier: Tesla has managed to upset people on both sides . He says it's a trend of brands getting hurt for the long term when they get political . Meier: ""Yes, but only if Musk stops focusing [LAUGHTER] on the soap opera""  Broadcom's revenue rose 20% on the year here . This is an AI fueled growth story that I think not a ton of people are talking about . The demand for AI chips remains high and is growing fast .  Broadcom's chips, we talk about Invidia and the GPUs that allow these, like, AI LLMs to run, are more of a connective tissue . They're working in the background doing memory and networking for running these AI workloads . Their customers include the big tech companies we talked about more often on the show .  David Meier: This is a bit of a good news, bad news quarter . But why is the stock down? It really is about the Billings and the subsequent guidance for the coming quarter .  Jason Moser: Billings that's ultimately a timing issue, so it can be difficult to predict . David Meier: I understand the billings concerns, but there was also a lot to like in the report . Total customers up 10%, surpassing 1.7 million in large customers .  Ricky Mulvey: The economy is in an interesting spot . The labor market looks hot on the surface, but it's a different story for college grads . Stacey Vanek Smith co hosts the podcast Everybody's Business from Bloomberg Business .  The U-6 rate, which includes marginally attached workers, is the biggest, broadest understanding of the labor market . Stacey Vanek Smith: This sounds like a labor market that is firing all cylinders, but there seems to be a lot of issues and problems under the surface .  Job market is something that you feel and affects our day to day lives . Unemployment numbers are the most easy to talk about of all economic indicators . But all signs would point to a bad job market, he says .  Stacey Vanek Smith: Job openings are up. Hiring went up more than expected. I don't know, Ricky Mulvey: I have some thoughts, but it's is such a disconnect. The Jolts report is an interesting one. That's one that I've called before the take your job and stuff it index .  Everyone I talked to felt pretty bad about the job market, except for one woman who was in engineering, who said she felt like everyone she knew had a job . Ricky Mulvey: Can you make any sense of that disconnect?  Fed Chief Stacey Vanek Smith says jobs are a lagging indicator because companies will often wait a little bit to lay people off if times get tough . Smith: Companies might be more hesitant than they would have been before to let people go, just knowing it can be hard to find good people .  It could just be the sectors that are hiring might be less visible than the other ones . Ricky Mulvey: ""I have trouble believing that, but I don't know. I'm looking at the numbers. It doesn't make any sense to me""  There is a tremendous amount of bias in that sample, Ricky Mulvey says . Stacey Vanek Smith: We're also journalists, and media is a hot mess right now. We might have a skewed view because the people we know and our colleagues, it's a difficult moment for media.

I always think about Argentina because of the protectionist tariffs in place in 2010 .  Stacey Vanek Smith: This was a big shock to me too. This was another layer of vibe session because when the inflation report was coming out, the consumer price index, the CPI, this last one, I was like, here we go, because the tariffs have now been in place for a few months . Even though there's been a lot of back and forth, businesses have been padding their prices .  Ricky Mulvey: ""It's like the Through the Looking-Glass economy. It is like the Lewis Carroll economy. Nothing seems to match up with what I think"" Stacey Vanek Smith: ""We are in a more volatile market.

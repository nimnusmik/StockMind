" Elon Musk says he is ""disappointed"" by the price tag of the ""big, beautiful bill"" The bill ""increases the budget deficit ... and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,"" Musk said in a CBS interview . Musk is not the only one in the world of tech who has questions .  Three of the four co-hosts of the ""All-In"" podcast called the bill a failure of leadership on Trump's part . The fourth Big Tech figure was David Sacks, the White House AI and crypto czar . Others in Silicon Valley have offered their support for certain provisions .  A new Morning Consult survey this week found 50% were opposed to the reconciliation package after its major components — from tax changes to decreased funding for Medicaid — were defined . The political pressure has had at least some effect on Trump, who went from saying the bill needed to ""send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!"" tosounding much more open to changes .  Musk and his DOGE allies rode into Washington months ago with giant promises to cut ""at least"" $2 trillion from the government's annual budget . The effort has shown little results even after causing chaos among the federal workforce and seeing Musk take a step back .  ""I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don't know if it's both,"" he joked . ""My personal opinion,"" he said .",negative,"musk, funding, budget, trillion, federal"

" In this podcast, Motley Fool co-founder and Chief Rule Breaker David Gardner joins host Ricky Mulvey for a conversation about how he thinks about valuation . They discuss Palantir's current valuation, and what investors should prepare for . The value of paying up for ""top dogs"" and holding on to them for long periods of time .  Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, available when you joinStock Advisor . Apple:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008,you’d have $37,070!* Netflix: If you invested in the company in 2004, you'd have $639,271!  Motley Fool co-founder and chief Rule Breaker David Gardner joined us for a conversation on today's show . Gardner: I've been thinking a lot about and not buying, maybe to my detriment, a company called Palantir . At the time of this writing, it's got a blistering valuation, about 95 times enterprise value to revenue .  David Gardner: Rule Breaker is focused not on all the stocks or the whole market . I focus on the innovator in each industry. That is trait number one of rule Breaker stocks and there are six traits .  You will never buy Palantir if you're trying to find a cheap, says Ricky Mulvey . That's true industry by industry, Ricky, for the rule breakers. who's the first mover, not just any industry . That, for me, is the way to maximize your returns as an investor .  David Gardner: Why are all the best companies always trading at premium valuations? Why wasIntuitive Surgicalwhen I first picked it in 2005, trading at something like 75 times earnings . Yet, it's gone up more than 100 times in value since then in the 20 succeeding years . Virtually every great company from Tesla to Netflix, the list goes on .  The performance of a company and the quality of its stock over time is directly correlated to its brand . Who the CEO is, what's the culture of the company? Can it innovate its way out of a box? What about its brand? None of those four is included anywhere in the financial statements .  Ricky Mulvey: What about their brand, the promise you make to your customers every day? This is an incredibly important point. It's one I try to make big in my rule Breaker Investing book that comes out this fall .  Some of the biggest winners in the full universe, some of which you mentioned, Amazon, Netflix, Mercado Libre, I use Y charts, which sometimes can mess some things up, especially for historic multiples . These often traded above ten times enterprise value to revenue, sometimes even 45 times if you look at an early Amazon . But, that's a comparative value town to where Palantir is today, which is a more mature company .  David Gardner: I think it's natural to recognize when companies are at all time high, not just for their stock, but for their valuation multiples . Gardner: When I buy a stock at a dead minimum, I'm holding it for at least three years. Preferably three decades. What ends up mattering is not the valuation multiple that you paid for 17 or seven years ago, which I can't even remember now. What matters far more.  The companies that are winning for everybody, not equally in all the time, but the companies that just keep winning, are winning . What really matters is the impact of that company in the world . Nvidia was my best stock pick for Motley Full Stock Advisor, the company behind AI .  Ricky Mulvey: The direction of the stock market is not parabolic . It's lower left to upper right, not always at the same time and sometimes downward . That's what enables me to buy a Palantir which I did not ten years ago .  Ricky Mulvey: There are things that people should know about Palantir, and that's just part of being a shareholder in them . He says it can create a digital twin of the organization, and then you can go in and decide what needs stocking, where, and what a complex logistics operation .  David Gardner: I still think trees can't grow to the sky more than 90 times enterprise value to revenue . Gardner: Palantir is up about four or five times the value since I first bought. It could be about to drop 50%, as indeed, we saw Nvidia do within the last couple of years .  Ricky Mulvey: I'm watching Netflix lose two thirds of its value in the face of its self inflicted gunshot wound known as Quickstar more than ten years ago, it's not fun to watch companies lose half or more of their value within inside of one year .  David Gardner: I think the earlier stage a company is, the less its valuation matters. The later stage it's, the more it matters. I think there's a perception that in order to really be a smart, successful investor, you need to be able to value stocks, and people will ask you questions, insinuating questions .  When he first wrote, really, when he came on the scene a century ago, the markets were so inefficient . The knowledge gap between people who had a balance sheet and people who couldn't look at the balance sheet was substantial . Over the course of the last century, that's largely been erased, he says .  Ricky Mulvey: Most managers care about what the next earnings are going to be and the quarter after that . David Gardner: There's a huge amount of money just sitting there on the valuations you're seeing every day on the markets .  If you're looking six years ahead instead of six quarters ahead or two quarters ahead, you will actually be playing almost your own game . What you're seeing are valuations that look in a two quarter period as if they're too high .  Most people are not playing the game that you and I will win which is to buy and to hold the great companies of our time . Ricky Mulvey: When you only look for cheap stocks, then you miss out on a lot of the big tech players and market-dominating companies that have emerged in the stock market .  There are times where not looking at valuation can bite investors and there are times when looking at valuations . For those who bought Shopify at the peaks of 2021, they're still down on that at the height of a recent cycle of investing excitement .  David Gardner: I think everybody should start with 20 stocks. With $1,000, you can have a 20 stock portfolio. I don't believe anybody should determine what they think about the stock market and investing directly in stocks based on one stock .  Ricky says dollar-cost averaging into stocks directly is the approach everybody should be taking . Ricky: We should all just constantly be investing every two weeks if we're wage earners, and adding to the market and the best companies that we can find . Ricky says he's not sure Shopify is back to its all time highs yet .  A few months ago there were a lot of people, at least on my Facebook feed saying, I'm shorting Tesla . That was actually probably the worst time to either sell or short the company, but that's still one with a very complicated future .  David Gardner: I think there are people in the let's say left and moderate that say, everywhere I drive. I don't want to necessarily promote a political affiliation with that. That harm to the brand may be undoable. Especially as people are making big purchases with electric cars .  If Tesla's not there for you, don't do it. For me, it is. I'm not about Elon Musk's politics. I think that Elon is a phenomenal innovator across multiple industries. There are lots of people who work at Tesla .  This is a company that created a revolution. Everybody else is still trying to catch up to the electric cars while Tesla is going to start bringing out robots. Robots are a bigger industry than cars and they won't be the only player. But I'm invested, because I love what the company does. I do drive a Tesla and I do so unashamedly .  The stock a year ago, the day we're recording, this conversation is Monday, May 19th was at 175 . Today, it's just short of 350. Ricky Mulvey:I think we're possibly missing the forest for the trees if we're getting too. I'm talking about anybody who thinks this is a serious problem and long term damage .  As we move forward, rule breakers can become rule makers . David Gardner: Not every company that goes through that process, rule breaker to rule maker stops growing at that point .  Amazon is a great example of the rule breakers that continue to break the rules as they lead their industry and the world forward . Netflix, Amazon, Nvidia and Netflix are examples of those who started out with David positioning and are now within their contexts, the Goliath, and they are innovating at a pace intuitive surgical .  I'm always going to have my money on the innovators and I love to find them as early as I can, like we did with Shopify . Shopify looks beautifully positioned to me today over the next 20 years. We're going to keep our investments in. Ricky .  Most people are simply not investing. They are trading which is the antithesis of investing . We are holding for at least three years, preferably three decades and not any company. We are specifically focused on the rule breakers and innovators .  Ricky Mulvey: I just took early retirement because I bought and held Nvidia because you guys did through some thick and some thin. That to me is how to invest. Thanks for listening .

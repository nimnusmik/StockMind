" Tesla’s strongest bulls believe the company's financials will get a massive boost as it makes progress with robotaxis and humanoid robots . Tesla generated 72% of its revenue in the first quarter (ended March 31) from the sale of its products .  Tesla is known for offering some of the most in-demand, tech-advanced, and well-designed EVs on the market . However, visionary founder and CEO Elon Musk believes Tesla's future will look different . There are two important projects that could, in theory, change the financial picture .  After years of strong double-digit revenue growth, Tesla's top line dipped 9% in the first quarter . Demand is under pressure, which has been due to higher interest rates . The industry has also now become much more competitive, as the cost of financing is more prohibitive .  It's so difficult to predict what Tesla will look like 10 or 20 years from now . Bullish investors appreciate the upside potential from FSD tech and humanoid robots . However, it's anyone's guess when, or if, this will become a reality on a global scale .  Tesla has probably minted some millionaires thanks to the stock's incredible ride higher in the past . But I'm not ready to say that the company will set new shareholders up for life . It's extremely rare to find a single company that can achieve this for your portfolio .  There may not be another chance like this anytime soon . Buying Tesla stock today could set you up for life, says Motley Fool .",positive,"tesla, future, bullish, musk, investors"
" President Donald Trump's new bill seeks to eliminate tax incentives for electric vehicles . Tesla's capital advantage keeps the business safe for now . But eliminating EV tax credits could have a surprising effect on competition .  Analysts expect the company to refresh its existing lineup, but details are scarce on releasing any brand new models in 2025 or 2026 . Even if a new model is released, it's unlikely that production will scale meaningfully over the next 12 to 24 months . Any potential demand boost from releasing a more affordable Model Y or Model 3 could be offset by eliminated tax credits .  Tesla has $16 billion in cash and equivalents on the books, more than every other competitor . Its profit margins are positive -- a rarity in the EV world -- meaning it can afford to cut profits a bit without going into the red . Tesla's biggest advantage is its $1 trillion market cap .  The elimination of EV tax credits could be a secret win for Tesla . Most of its EV competition comes from unprofitable companies with minimal room for error like RivianandLucid Group . ExxonMobil wishes for a carbon tax to be implemented . A carbon tax would make its output more expensive to buyers .  The EV tax credit may end up in place until 2032 like previously planned . The elimination of these subsidies certainly won't ""kill"" Tesla . There's an argument that it could be a long-term advantage due to lessened competition .  Right now, we’re issuing ‘Double Down’ alerts for three incredible companies . There may not be another chance like this anytime soon .",positive,"tesla, ev, exxonmobil, profits, tax"
" Federal tax credits for electric vehicles could soon be eliminated . More than 90% of Tesla's sales come from just two models: The Model X .  Last quarter, Tesla posted a $409 million net profit, partially realized by $595 million in automotive regulatory credits . The fate of these credits is very unclear right now, but their elimination would likely further dampen Tesla's sales growth .  Tesla will lose a critical revenue source with nearly 100% profit margins . With EV deliveries already declining, the loss of federal EV tax credits or regulatory credits could put Tesla in an even more precarious position . Now is the best time to buy before it’s too late .  Every Tesla investor should keep an eye on these two numbers . There may not be another chance like this anytime soon . Tesla is one of the top three companies in the U.S. market .",negative,"tesla, ev, tax, revenue, profit"

" Tesla's stock is down over 20% this year, and last quarter, it reported its biggest-ever drop in deliveries alongside itsweakest profitin four years . Tesla is still the top EV seller in the US, for now, but it’s facing threats on multiple fronts .  A third of Americans had afavorable views of Musk in April, a 9% drop from December . 65% of Americans said the billionaire CEO had too much influence on the federal government .  Since 2020, Tesla has launched only the Cybertruck, which hasn’t become the top-seller that Musk promised . Tesla sold 40,000 Cybertrucks last year, a far cry from its goal of 250,000 . Analyst says Tesla needs to introduce an affordable, mass-market car that can compete with a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla .  The Model Y is Tesla’s top seller and was the best-selling EV overall in the US last year . A down-market model “could be their biggest mass market seller” and “outsell the Model Y,” Moloughney said .  Tesla CEO Elon Musk plans to launch robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, as soon as next Sunday . Musk has been promising that fully autonomous Teslas would arrive within a year every year since 2016 .  Tesla has a market value of about $1 trillion, more than 20 times that of GM . Musk has said investors that don’t believe Tesla will solve autonomous driving should sell their Tesla stock .  The company’s success or failure at the next bend in the road could determine its future . Elon Musk's focus is breaking into the auto industry to become an electric-vehicle leader .",negative,"tesla, teslas, musk, robotaxi, cybertruck"
" Tesla shares are off by 8% (and a lot more) in June versus a 2% gain for the S&P 500 . Investors fear Trump will take aim at Musk's various lines of business . The president isn't one to forget digs, ever .  Tesla's stock is up 12% since October 2022, but consensus EPS estimates for 2025, 2026, and 2027 have since plunged 77%, 70%, and 71%, respectively . The stock is valued at a significant premium to the broader market despite EV tax credit extension .  Tesla's forward price-to-earnings multiple stands at an eye-popping 166 times compared to 22 times for the S&P 500 . Tesla is heading into at least two years of heavy investment to support robot building and robotaxi operations .  The stock has to correct for these elements to the story, says Brinkman . The past few years, it has morphed into more of a CEO and sports celeb scene, making it fertile ground to get clues on the economy .

" Tesla and BYD are two of the largest players in the electric vehicle space . BYD has outperformed Tesla in China lately . Investors seem more interested in Tesla's future initiatives than its EV business .  Tesla reported 337,000 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2025, the lowest amount seen in over two years . Elon Musk's brand has seemingly alienated many, including current and potential Tesla customers . Increased competition in the EV space also seems to be taking market share from Tesla .  The bulls are banking on future initiatives such as Tesla's robotaxi service and the humanoid Optimus robots to hold the valuation up . Tesla recently began rolling out its first self-driving robotaxis in Austin, Texas, in a highly anticipated event .  BYD captured over 30% of the EV market in China, compared to Tesla's 6% . The company is reportedly building cheaper EVs that work better and have better charging capabilities than Tesla . Analysts expect BYD to grow earnings in 2025 by nearly 24% .  BYD trades at 25 times earnings, compared to Tesla at 179 . BYD may not have the same upside as a company like Tesla because the company isn't planning on rolling out robots or FSD technology . However, BYD is demonstrating strong growth and its core products are outperforming .

" China granted rare earth export licenses to GM, Ford, and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) but not to Tesla . China controls nearly 100% of global supply for the seven most critical heavy rare earth elements . U.S. auto sector is the largest end-user of these materials, but America’s consumption is a fraction of global output .  Wells Fargo warns the current arrangement is “still a band-aid, not a fix,” with supply risks likely to persist for another two to five years as new capacity ramps up outside China . For now, China’s selectivity in granting licenses and vigilance over end-use means Tesla could face mounting pressure .",neutral,"tesla, china, earth, america, supply"

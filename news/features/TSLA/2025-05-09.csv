" Jeff Bezos-backed Slate is a new car company planning to build electric trucks in the Midwest for 2026 delivery . Competing electric trucks from Tesla and Rivian cost 3 to 4 times more than Slate's compact EV truck . Slate is an electric car company still firmly in start-up mode .  Slate describes its new electric truck as ""the most radically simple, wildly personalizable vehicle out there"" Pre-orders of Slate trucks, secured by a refundable $50 deposit, began last week . It's likely they've already begun to affect sales of Tesla Cybertrucks and Rivian R1T trucks .  Slate's $69,990 entry price is compared to $71,700 a base Rivian R1T or the $77,700 MSRP on a Rivian . Cybertruck is described as the best-selling vehicle in America, ""priced above $100,000""  Blank Slate is a 150-mile range electric truck in two-door pickup configuration . I skipped right past options to add decals or ""wrap"" the Slate in a different color . I similarly skipped upgrades for all-terrain tires and bigger tires, and left the wheels alone .  Slate offers the option to ""bring your own"" configuration in which neither stereo nor speakers are installed . Instead, you can add a speaker mount, phone holder, and Bluetooth controls on the steering wheel . Slate doesn't show the price effect of any of its personalization options .  The vast majority of the personalization options seem entirely skippable, without affecting the functionality of the truck . This suggests that buying a bare-bones Slate for close to the advertised price -- again, that's under $20,000 after government tax incentives .  The Motley Fool’s total average return is893% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to162% for the S&P 500 . Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of the 10 stocks that made the cut .

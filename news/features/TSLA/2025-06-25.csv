" Elon Musk and U.S. President Trump had a public spat in which Musk seemingly burned bridges with Trump and his supporters . That seems bad for Musk’s business interests, as it could see Tesla and SpaceX lose valuable government grants and contracts . But in the immediate term at least, X is spinning it as a positive .  X has seen an 8% rise on overall daily active usage in the last two weeks, versus the first week of June (the Trump/Elon stoush kicked off at the end of that first week). X has repeatedly noted that its daily active user count is250 million, where it’s been sitting since November 2022 .  X’s average MAU/DAU ratio had been at 50% for some time, potentially till this year . This is a decline on previous usage, but an increase is better . For comparison, the average figure for all the major social apps is just over 50%, so X is still behind the norm .  X isn't growing at a rapid rate, and as such, it isn’t boosting its advertiser appeal . With a significant debt burden (as part of Musk’s funding to buy the company), along with potential fines incoming from EU authorities, X will once again be very close to, if not below break even in 2025 .  Despite X’s reporting, its official figures show that X is slowly declining in usage . But if it can keep propping up those numbers every now and then, and promote that as a rise in interest, then maybe that’ll help to keep advertiser interest somewhat stable .",positive,"debt, musk, declining, tesla, spacex"

Trump posted on Truth Social that Musk was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he didn't want) Musk called the bill a “disgusting abomination” However, after his light criticism was public, he announced that he would get out of DOGE.

By mid-afternoon, swipes had given way to threats .  “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!” Trump posted on social media Thursday, after earlier telling reporters he was “very disappointed” in Musk over harsh criticism of a Republican tax and spending bill . Musk declared on X, his social media platform, that Trump's claim he asked Musk to leave the government was ‘an obvious lie”  The descent into public recrimination was startling, even by Trump’s volatile standard, which often sees former allies and underlings cast aside without fanfare . Musk alleged Trump's name appeared in files related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein . The White House declined to comment .  Trump accused Musk of trying to tank the spending bill because its elimination of electric vehicle credits hurt Tesla’s bottom line . Musk took to social media posts to deny the Oval Office comments and taunt the president with his own past postings .  Musk’s public break with Trump threatens further fallout for the allies he helped to install in key positions across federal agencies . It also raises questions about whether the biggest billionaire spender of the 2024 election will remain a reliable source of campaign funding to sustain Republican control of the House .  Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist, says he warned Trump and his inner circle about Musk . Bannon says Musk’s downfall from his status as “Chief Buddy” was inevitable . “He was too incompetent and lied about being able to find a trillion dollars of cuts in waste, fraud and abuse,” says Bannon .

DOGE says it has saved taxpayers about $180 billion year-to-date but only accounts for less than half that number .  Musk appealed to House Speaker Mike Johnson to save tax credits for electric vehicles, a source says . Johnson says Musk seems ""pretty dug in right now, and I can't quite understand the motivation behind it"" Musk's criticism of the spending package built slowly, but he lashed out on social media on Tuesday .  The rift between the two billionaire showmen had seemed to be widening for a while . Even as Musk embraced his DOGE role and continued making periodic appearances at the White House, he broke with some of Trump’s policies .  Musk's sojourn through the West Wing left a sour taste for some officials, according to an outside adviser and one person within the administration . The outside adviser particularly noted Musk’s brusque treatment of Wiles, a longtime Wiles ally, who was sent to serve as NASA chief of staff .  A person familiar with SpaceX discounted the chance that bad blood between Musk and Trump would have an immediate negative effect on the company . But the person said there is frustration that the company’s brand has been damaged . The person said Hughes had long wanted to work at NASA, not an effort to keep tabs on Musk and SpaceX .  Elon Musk has long wanted to turn X into an ‘everything app,’ he says . “A lot of the regulations that would have inhibited that are going away,” Musk says .",negative,"musk, trump, billionaire, tesla, fraud"

The drop on Thursday partially reversed a big runup in theeight weeks since Musk confirmed that Tesla would be testing an autonomous, driverless service in Austin, Texas, this month .  Trump's threat to cut government contracts seems targeted more to another of Musk's businesses, SpaceX, than his car company . The privately held rocket company has received billions of dollars for sending astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station . The company is currently racing to develop a mega rocket for the space agency to send astronauts to moon next year .  After the presidential election in November, investors rushed into the stock, adding more than $450 billion to its value in a few weeks .

Musk doesn't exactly have a political constituency of his own, but he's a kind of demigod for iconoclastic libertarians in the Joe Rogan mold . The bill wouldadd at least $2.4 trillion to the national debt .  The national debt now at a whopping $36.2 trillion and only heading higher . Moody's rating agency just became the third to downgrade the US debt rating .  Many congressional Republicans were happy when Musk wound down his DOGE work and left Washington .

""This feud does not change our bullish view ofTeslaand the autonomous view,"" says SIEBERT FINANCIAL .  Musk and Trump both represent a rethink about global power dynamics with big companies catching up to what it can do . ""It's odd that someone like Elon is being seen as a motivating force for people to stand up and say they care about the deficit, suddenly""  Trump and Musk seem to agree on being very supply-driven in their actions, but as Musk has gotten a taste of government powerholding and delegating, his opinions may only get stronger and prove an affront to White House goals . Stock enthusiasm in general domestically has gone down, but we shall see if Musk is able to have an influence as a guiding hand or play a role .  Tesla is fundamentally worth no more than around $10/share versus the current $300 . ""I see no meaningful fallout from this for the rest of the market, other than its slight effect on the indexes and index funds""  There are some reports that DOGE will probably cost more than money than saved .

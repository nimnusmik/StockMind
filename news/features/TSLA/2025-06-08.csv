" Elon Musk and Donald Trump are polarizing figures with a penchant for dropping verbal bombshells . The rift may shock some, however, given how closely Musk and Trump worked together over the past year . Trump even hosted a Tesla showroom on the White House lawn to support Musk .  Hedge fund manager Doug Kass predicted the break-up as one of his top 15 surprises for 2025 . Kass also predicted a stock market reckoning could cause the S&P 500 to fall 15% . Kass recently revisited his take on Musk and Trump .  Kass beat the bearish drum continuously through February, when the S&P 500 reversed after hitting all-time highs . From mid-February through early April, bombshells in the form of President Trump and job losses stemming from Musk's DOGE efforts caused the benchmark index to fall .  At its worst, the S&P 500 fell 19%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell about 24% . Kass reversed course, making bargain-basement buys on the indexes and tech leaders, including Amazon, near the lows . Trump's pause on tariffs and potential for trade deals that ease the tariffs' bite have helped fuel a dramatic recovery .  Tesla sales cratered in key markets, including Europe and California, the largest U.S. auto market . Tesla's stock price got hammered as a result, falling 54% from mid-December highs to early April lows . It's since recovered alongside the broad market, jumping 35% on news Elon Musk would step down from DOGE .  Kass predicts the end of the Trump-Musk relationship . ""Surprise #2: The 'other' romance, between Trump/Musk, doesn't make it past spring 2025,"" he wrote . Kass's list of ""surprises"" includes the S&P 500 sell-off, the Trump presidency version 1.0 .  Kass: Musk and Trump will suffer a fallout, which may have consequences for investors . Kass: ""In the end (probably sooner than later) — just like the president's opening salvos of ridiculously high tariff proposals — the two actors will likely have a detente (and kiss and make up) because the downside is certain for both of them, as no one will win.""  Kass's view of what happens to the stock market next isn't encouraging . ""I see seven lean months ahead for our markets. We estimate downside risk to be roughly 3x the upside reward,"" concludes Kass . If Kass is correct that instability will force stocks lower, how low could it go?

They are targeting the mid-sized SUV market that represents one of the largest and fastest-growing segments of the vehicle market . Tesla didn't launch its affordable Model Y and Model 3 vehicles until 2019 and 2020 respectively .  Last year's capital infusion from Volkswagen was critical for Rivian .

" Tesla Inc. stock traded down 14.3% to $284.70 on Thursday, the company's second-biggest percentage loss in more than a year . The decline wascaused by an escalated feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump .  Trump posted a series of messages on his Truth Social account speaking out against Musk .

Musk said the president’s comments on the EV mandate are ""an obvious lie""  The Dragon spacecraft was recently used to bring two stranded astronauts home from the International Space Station . Musk also suggested that Trump's tariffs ""will cause a recession in the economy""  Tesla stock suffered its second-largest fall year-to-date, narrowly beaten by a 15.4% drop on March 10 . That March 10 drop was the largest percentage loss for Tesla shares in five years . The largest single-day percentage drop for Tesla stock was on Sept. 8, 2020 .  Tesla stock fell 19.3% on Jan. 13, 2012 after two key departures were announced . After a record 21.1% drop on September 8, 2020, Tesla stock rose 10.9% the next day .

" Elon Musk's involvement with Donald Trump has been a car wreck that’s unfolded in two chapters, one in slow motion, the next on dizzying fast-forward . During Musk's 130 days running DOGE, a crusade whose dogged aggression virtually defined the administration's mindset in the early months, the EV chief infuriated European customers by backing far-right politicians .  Musk has singlehandedly turned that “insurance policy” into a liability, says Jonathan Talley, a Columbia University professor of law and business at Columbia University . Talley: Being in the White House also included a bit of an insurance policy for Tesla . Musk-Trump feud that exploded on June 5th, triggered by the former’s lacerating takedown of the President's signature budget .  The blowup sent Tesla shares reeling 14.3% in a freefall that erased $153 billion in market cap . Though it clawed back around a third of those losses the following day, the stock’s still sitting 40% below its recent summit in mid-December .  In any other major public company but Tesla, Musk would be gone . What keeps Musk in the job is his iron grip on the board, says Elson . Elson reckons that it would be extremely difficult for disgruntled shareholders to prevail in lawsuits .  Tesla re-incorporated from Delaware to Texas makes it much tougher for liability cases against directors, Elson says . Elson: Musk can't be forced to leave, and won’t go unless he wants to, “and there’s nothing anybody can do about it”  The board under Texas law could either attempt to restore the package unilaterally, or put the issue to a shareholder vote . It's unclear how Musk will react if the Delaware Supreme Court rules against him . A turn down raises another potentially ghoulish outcome .  Tesla enjoys a gigantic premium courtesy of Musk’s iconic status and the serial promises of delivering self-driving technology that will transform Tesla from a metal-bender into a fabulously lucrative tech player . As I detailed after Q1 results, it actually lost money selling cars and batteries and only managed a tiny profit through the sales of regulatory credits .  Musk has a cult status that seems to follow him and make folks think it’s okay that he doesn’t operate in a normal way . But, Elson cautions, as Musk's behavior gets more and more outrageous, the burden he's heaping on Tesla, now and what investors increasing perceive is looming, is catching up .",negative,"musk, tesla, insurance, liability, shareholder"

The automaker’s shares took a tumble as the back-and-forth took over the news cycle, dropping 14% in on Thursday . Now analysts warn that feuding with Trump could cost Tesla billions, considering that Trump could repeal electric vehicle tax credits and other measures that have boosted Tesla's earnings .  The Trump-Musk spat is just the latest in a series of events that have forced the question of what role Tesla’s board actually plays in the company . It has long faced criticisms for being too close to Musk, and therefore willing to overlook management issues .

Musk is a controlling shareholder in Tesla, where he holds22% of the voting power . The directors are also paid very well .  There were signs earlier this year that Tesla’s directors were taking more control . The board denied the report outright, with Denholm calling it “absolutely false”  There are technically ways that shareholders could move the needle if they wanted Musk out . But board experts agree that to expect action from the Tesla board is misguided . Shareholders could try to sue the board for not kicking Musk to the curb .  A Tesla board director could try to bring about change by suggesting Musk go . But they would have to make peace with potentially losing their roles, says Elson . Whether they'll do that depends on whether they’re people of principle, he added .",negative,"musk, tesla, shareholder, shareholders, donald"

The departure of one of Tesla’s top engineers adds to what has already been a troubling week for the electric vehicle maker .

Now, as the vehicles proliferate, some politicians, public-safety officials and advocates are pushing for more rules . Austin police officers continually have run into problems with autonomous vehicles freezing up .  The Texas legislature passed a bill last month that would require autonomous-vehicle companies to apply for authorization to operate in the state . It is unclear when the new system would take effect, but likely not until next year, a state Department of Motor Vehicles spokesperson said .

The rules governing driverless vehicles in Texas are notably light . Texas is popular choice for companies in early stages of autonomous service .  Tesla has embraced a different approach to autonomy, favoring a camera-only system rather than a combination of lidar, radar and pre-mapping that competitors use .

The launch of its lower-priced R2 SUV will be a big driver moving forward .  For the quarter, Rivian's gross margin was 16.6% compared to 16.3% for Tesla . It's a monumental shift from just a year ago, when Rivian had a negative gross margin of 44% . The company is now looking to lean more into its higher-margin software .  The company's R1 remains one of the best-selling luxury electric SUVs in the U.S. But its high price tag limits its overall market .

Management said the decline in deliveries was due to higher-than-usual fourth-quarter deliveries of electric vans it makes for Amazon . Meanwhile, the company was able to shrink its loss from $1.5 billion a year ago to $541 million .  A successful launch of its R2 SUV next year will be pivotal in the company's future .

Wood and other investors are optimistic about the stock . The fundamentals of its electric vehicle business are deteriorating, and its new initiatives are speculative .  Tesla's market share in the United States as a percentage of EVs sold has fallen from 75% in the first quarter of 2022 to 43.5% in 2025 . Revenue declined 20% year over year last quarter .

" Tesla created the electric vehicle market, proving to legacy automakers that they needed to view the technology as a legitimate business threat . The vast majority of the EVs Tesla sold were sedans and SUVs . In 2024, Tesla sold nearly 1.8 million EVs across all of its vehicle .  Tesla's ""other"" vehicle sales fell by nearly 50% between the fourth quarter of 2024 (23,640 vehicles) and the first quarter of 2025 (12,881) That's not a good sign for Tesla's truck offering .  Rivian's production of 50,000 EV trucks is fairly close to the size of Tesla's ""other"" category, which includes its Cybertruck model . In the first quarter of 2025, Rivian sold around 8,000 trucks, which is about 60% of the number of vehicles sold by Tesla . However, there's a bigger picture issue here .  Tesla's Cybertruck has, to be polite, a polarizing appearance . Rivian's consumer vehicles are far more traditional and, thus, likely to be more appealing to a broader range of customers . Even if it can increase its production to the same level as Tesla has achieved, it doesn't offer a huge amount of growth potential .  The Motley Fool Stock Advisor's total average return is 907% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to163% for the S&P 500 .

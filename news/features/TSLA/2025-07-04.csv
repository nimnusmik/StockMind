Self-driving cars are still a new, evolving technology and I do not personally think there is a single correct way to build and scale these platforms .

" Tesla is more in the business of generating government credits than building cars . Compliance credits responsible for about 40 per cent of the company’s profit in 2024 . Globally in 2024, it reported US $2.8 billion in revenue from the sale of credits .  Tesla sold nearly 32,000 credits to BMW, Honda, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota between 2020 and 2024 . The going rate for a credit is not a matter of public record, but as Ottawa tightens the ZEV screws, Tesla's market for credits is poised to expand across the country .  Federal policy should push automakers toward buying credits from Tesla, Kingston says . Tesla CEO has been “directly hostile” to Canada, Kingston adds . Ottawa has reworked another key ZEV support policy in response to Musk’s antagonism . Tesla was also booted from a series of provincial rebate programs this spring .  In the current climate, Ottawa doing anything to pad Tesla's margins is at best a bad look . At worst, it's a betrayal of the government's purported support for local autoworkers and its commitment to fight back against aggressive U.S. trade policy .",positive,"tesla, automakers, credit, honda, credits"
" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is among the top officials tasked with landing a slew of trade deals .

Commerce Secretary Lutnick enjoys one of the closest relationships to the president among Cabinet secretaries . In public, the Commerce chief exudes swagger – much like Trump – in public . He is frequently with Trump because the president wants him there, a source says .  Lutnick initially aligned with Peter Navarro to back the aggressive rollout of tariffs .

On Capitol Hill, lawmakers gave him a rough ride on everything from tariffs to lobster fishing .  Ethics groups slammed Lutnick for telling Americans, in a TV interview, to buy Tesla Inc. stock after the price had dropped . On a podcast, he argued that only “fraudsters” would complain if they didn’t get their Social Security checks .  Lutnick was one of the longest-tenured chiefs on Wall Street . He positioned Cantor as a scrappy outsider, calling it the “biggest little guy” in finance . He presided over a rebuild of the firm after 658 employees — including his younger brother — were killed in the World Trade Center on 9/11 .  Lutnick alienated many Trump allies by putting his own hat into the ring for Treasury secretary . Bessent won support from Elon Musk and Steve Bannon and chief of staff Susie Wiles, among others .

Eliminating tax incentives could have an odd effect on Rivian's competitiveness .  Rivian is preparing to start production of three new affordable models: the R2, R3, and R3X . Production is slated to begin in early 2026, but I'm not expecting full production of all three models until 2027 or 2028 . Rivian has $4.7 billion in cash, plus a deal withVolkswagenthat could deliver several more billion dollars in capital .  Rivian's vehicles are priced between $70,000 and $100,000 depending on the package . If the company can price three new vehicles under the $50,000 mark, that makes its lineup significantly more affordable . That will allow sales to surge, and also provide significantly more operational leverage, likely improving profit margins .

ConsiderLucid Group aims to release several new mass market vehicles over the coming years .  Rivian is already profitable on a gross margin basis, unlike Lucid .

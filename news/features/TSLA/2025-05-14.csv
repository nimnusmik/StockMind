" Robyn Denholm, the chair of the board of directors, sold nearly $200 million worth of Tesla stock in the past six months . That brings her total proceeds from Tesla stock sales to more than half a billion dollars since taking over as board chair in 2018 .  Denholm recently purchased 112,000 shares at $24.73 each and sold them the same day for more than $270 apiece . Some critics question whether Denholm and other board members are truly independent .  Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla’s board had quietly explored CEO succession options . Board members reached out to several executive search firms to work on a formal process for finding the next CEO . Tesla and Denholm publicly denied the report, with Denholm reaffirming support for Musk .  Denholm and other Tesla directors haven’t received new stock options since mid-2021 . The compensation she’s working through now is essentially the tail end of a long, extraordinarily lucrative run, not a reflection of fresh board rewards .",neutral,"ceo, shares, tesla, stock, denholm"

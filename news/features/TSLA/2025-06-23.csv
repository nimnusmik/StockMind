" Tesla has started giving rides in driverless Model Y SUVs in Austin, a decade after CEO Elon Musk began making — and breaking — promises about his company’s ability to launch such a service . The rollout will become the first big test of Musk's belief that it's possible to deploy fully autonomous vehicles using just cameras and end-to-end AI .  A Tesla employee will be sitting in the right front passenger seat as a “safety monitor . The robotaxi service will be small to start, according to Musk . The initial fleet will be about 10 or so 2025 Model Y SUVs operating in a narrow area of Austin .  The Autonocast co-host of TechCrunch's Autoncast found a Tesla robotaxi depot in South Austin . He spotted several driverless Model Ys entering and exiting the parking lot the day before the launch . One of the branded robotaxis suddenly hit its brakes two separate times .  Tesla has actively tried to suppress information about the robotaxi service . The company has also tried to block the city of Austin from fulfilling a records request by Reuters . Musk shared dribs and drabs about the launch in interviews and posts .  Tesla is rolling out autonomous vehicles with a human safety monitor . It's unclear what role these safety monitors will play and how much, if any, they will have . Tesla is not using the futuristic vehicles, dubbed Cybercabs, thatwere revealed on October 10, 2024 .  Tesla Model Y vehicles are equipped with what Musk describes as a new, ‘unsupervised” version of Full Self-Driving software . The company says it will only be used if a rider requests support or in the case of an emergency .  “Robotaxi launch party” from an undisclosed location . “Culmination of a decade of hard work,” Musk wrote . But at least one rider on Sunday reported having an experience where Tesla’s remote support team had to help .",neutral,"robotaxi, tesla, robotaxis, driverless, austin"

" Ark Invest's price targets on Tesla shouldn't be taken too literally and may prove overly optimistic . Tesla has a history of overpromising and underdelivering on full self-driving . The investment company's price target won't be ""right,"" but then again, it's not supposed to be .  Tesla's current stock price in 2025 is about $320 . Ark Invest simulations show a 25% chance that Tesla's stock price will be $2,000 or less in 2029 . The modeling itself is almost certainly wrong, simply because it relies on variables that are incredibly hard to predict .  Tesla's share price is highly sensitive to the timing and scaling of its robotaxi and Full Self-Driving capabilities . The $2,600 price target for 2029 assumes that at that point, 88% of Tesla's enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) will be attributable to its robotics business, and just 9% to its electric vehicle sales .  Everything is riding on Tesla's robotaxi bet . Tesla's unsupervised Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is unproven . The auto industry as a whole has invested billions into the various efforts to develop a fully autonomous vehicle .  Tesla is launching its robotaxi service, and it has the vehicles, the data hoard, and the cash reserves to make it work . It's ideally placed to start producing lower-cost EVs (which can be used as robotaxis controlled by unsupervised FSD systems), and the company says it's set to begin volume production in 2026 .

" Former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich says government shouldn't be run like a business . Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in March that if a commercial company operated like the government, it would go bankrupt .

He says government should not be focused on profit, but that's okay . Reich: Government should make life better for the people .  Reich listed services like schools, highways, libraries, national parks, and mail delivery as examples of public goods that aren’t supposed to turn a profit . “Wall Street would love to have its hands on your Social Security,” he said . Reich added that PresidentDonald Trumpishardly a model for business success .

" Elon Musk reflected on his early mindset in a 2015 interview with astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson . Musk said he wanted to prove to himself that he could still survive in America . ""In America, it's pretty easy to keep yourself alive,"" Musk said .  Musk challenged himself to live on just $1 a day for food . His grocery list included hot dogs, oranges, pasta, and bulk green peppers . Musk immigrated to the U.S. from South Africa in the mid-1990s, during his early twenties .  In the mid-90s, the average cost of a loaf of bread was under $1, and hot dogs ran about $1.29 per pound . Now, decades later, he controls some of the most valuable companies in the world and has anestimated net worth topping $340 billion .  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average cost of food per person per month in 2024 will be over $300 . A $1 daily food budget in today's economy breaks down to 33 cents per meal . For millions ofAmericans now facing food insecurity, that number is unthinkable .  Musk challenged himself to live off hot dogs and oranges . He believed that if he could handle having nothing, he could risk everything . That mindset helped him bet big onrockets, electric cars, solar panels—and win .

" The German carmaker is preparing to enter the market for autonomous ride-hailing services next year . Instead of competing against existing transportation providers, it aims to work with them as a partner .  VW wants to be partners that build upon existing infrastructure . The German carmaker wants to offer local transportation authorities and other commercial fleets a turnkey solution that can be integrated effortlessly into their service .  The first roughly 500 vehicles won’t be deployed to Uber for use in Los Angeles until next year . VW believes there will be more than enough demand to grab a bite out of the €350 billion-€450 billion in revenue in North America and Europe by 2035 .  The group’s go-to-market strategy heavily incorporates public transit authorities . With their extensive wealth of well-built mass transit networks, these mainly state and municipal-owned companies play a role in urban, suburban and ex-urban mobility .  BVG-branded robotaxi integrated into its service should see far faster adoption than were Volkswagen to compete alongside it . In Silicon Valley, regulators are often viewed with suspicion, at worst the enemy .  Only Volkswagen and Hyundai remain in contention from the legacy car industry . Meyer readily admits it’s likely only a matter of time until Tesla can graduate to a full commercial robotaxi service .  Volkswagen is planning to produce at least 10,000 robotaxi vehicles, potentially more .

" Elon Musk promised in 2019 that driverless Tesla “robotaxis” would be on the road “next year,” but it didn’t happen . A test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, began Sunday . Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year .  The robotaxi test begins in Austin this afternoon with customers paying a $4.20 flat fee . Tesla is remotely controlled by a remote control car remotely . A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18 .  The number of Teslas deployed will also be small — just 10 or 12 vehicles . The service will only pick up passengers in a limited, geofenced area . Musk has vowed that the service will quickly spread to other cities .  Tesla CEO Musk has come under fire for exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves . The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment .  Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe . He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country .  Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others could be a reach . But even skeptics acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so .",neutral,"tesla, teslas, robotaxi, robotaxis, musk"

" Tesla ended policy that prohibited U.S. leasing customers from buying their cars at lease-end . The policy started in 2019, when Tesla announced that customers could lease its mass-market Model 3 sedans but would have to return them, at the end of the lease, for use in Tesla's planned ""robotaxi"" network .  The practice was an easy way to ""jack up the price"" of the used vehicles, one of the people said . Tesla and Musk didn't respond to requests for comment for this story .

Salespeople would cite the software upgrades to those interested in buying . For those seeking leases, they continued saying the cars would be used for robotaxis .

" Rivian Automotive (RIVN) continues to endure a bumpy road to success in the electric vehicle(EV) space . The most recent quarter,reported in early May, did show some positive signs, particularly with margin improvements . Rivian doesn’t have a large cash buffer as it once did, and the investment thesis still carries more risk than reward .  Rivian recently reported production of 14,611 vehicles and 8,640 deliveries for the quarter ending in March . Both numbers came in above the company’s own guidance of 14,000 and 8,000, respectively . Rivian is still burning cash and hasn't reached profitability .  Management reaffirmed its 2025 guidance of 46,000 to 51,000 vehicle deliveries . Rivian stock surged more than 15% after its Q1 earnings release last week . The company delivered over 51,500 vehicles in 2024 and 50,122 in 2023 .  The average selling price (ASP) in the quarter came in at $107,000, a massive jump from $82,000 a year ago . That suggests customers are leaning toward higher-end models . Software and services revenue tripled in the same period last year . The year-over-year delivery dip might look worrying but it’s not necessarily a red flag .  R2 is shaping up to be a critical milestone for Rivian . Investors are starting to believe that R2 could be the turning point that leads to longer-term margin expansion and grand scale . Rivian currently has $7.7 billion in cash and short-term investments .  Rivian's heavy reliance on future funding remains a big concern for shareholders . Recent margin improvements signal a move away from constant capital dilution, which has helped drive the stock higher . Rivian has $4.89 billion in total debt .  Wall Street isn't showing much love for Rivian stock . Among the 25 analysts covering the stock, seven are bullish, 14 are neutral, and four are bearish . Rivian's average stock price target is $13.96, which implies a downside potential of 6% .  Rivian has so much left to prove before it becomes a consistently profitable business . For the time being, I think it’s best to keep Rivian on the sidelines and not get too excited about recent progress .",positive,"rivian, rivn, automotive, stock, profitability"

Tesla bear Gordon Johnson foresees North America's leading EV maker declining to $24.86 per share . This oddly specific price target was arrived at by Johnson placing a forward-earnings multiple of 15 on shares of Tesla .  Johnson has previously shared a number of concerns about Tesla, including the rise of global EV competition eating into its bottom line . Tesla has slashed the price on its fleet (Model's 3, S, X, and Y) on numerous occasions to combat rising inventory and account for tepid EV demand .

Palantir Technologies' AI-driven Gotham software-as-a-service platform isn't duplicable . Public companies that have no one-for-one replacement typically command healthy valuation premiums . The issue is that its stock peaked at north of 100 times sales in recent weeks . The company's profit-driving Gotham segment is also constrained by a narrow client pool .  Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng says Upstart Holdings is one of the hottest AI stocks since the COVID-19 pandemic . If Ng is accurate, Upstart shareholders would lose 65% of their existing investment . Gotham's reasonably low long-term ceiling clamps down on Palantir's outlandish valuation premium .

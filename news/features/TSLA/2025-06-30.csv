" Tesla debuts its driverless car service in a limited public rollout in Austin, Texas . The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) hasopened an investigation into the service .  The robotaxi launch featured about 10 cars traveling in a limited area of Austin with safety drivers in the passenger seat . Rides, which the company offered to a host of handpicked influencers, cost $4.20, in keeping with Musk’s proclivity for cannabis memes .  Footage from at least 11 rides showed that the trial run did not pan out as flawlessly as Tesla’s tweet suggested . In one case, a robotaxi failed to make a left turn and instead drove into a lane meant for oncoming traffic . The videos drew the attention of the NHTSA, which said in a statement it was aware of the incidents .  Tesla’s consumer vehicles come with ‘autopilot’ and ‘full self-driving’ features that allow drivers to cruise on the highway hands-free . The reliance on cameras alone stands in sharp contrast with other autonomous vehicle companies such as Waymo .  Lidar and radar allow for self-driving cars to better detect objects in bad weather and poor lighting . “Lidar is lame,” Musk said during a Tesla autonomy day in 2019 . Musk maintains that camera-only technology is the most “human” way to approach self-driven .  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuits . Lawyer: Tesla has a fetishistic view that it’s going to operate its system solely on cameras, despite every intelligent human being in this space saying that can’t be done .  Waymo is seen widely as the frontrunner in the self-driving race in the US . The Google subsidiary has historically spent months, if not years, mapping cities and testing its vehicles in them before launching . In San Francisco, one of the first cities where Waymo launched its fully driverless commercial service, the company began mapping and testing in 2021 before launching it to the public in 2024 .  Waymo launched as a project under Google’s X research lab in 2009 . Earlier this year, more than 1,200 of its vehicles had to be recalled over a software issue that was causing collisions with chains and gates .  Tesla also did not have a permit to operate its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas . Uber was forced to shut down the service a week later after the DMV revoked its registration . Tesla also does not currently have a process to acquire a permit .  Tesla has been promising that Teslas will be fully self-driving since at least 2016 . The deadline has been deferred several times over the past 10 years .",neutral,"driverless, tesla, teslas, robotaxi, driving"

" Tesla could lose market share again in the quarter amid weakening sales . Confirmation of a lower-cost vehicle in production could boost the stock . Elon Musk's company typically releases its production and delivery data for the quarter shortly after the quarter ends .  Tesla likely to reveal data indicating that Tesla lost share in the electric vehicle (EV) market . Tesla sells directly to consumers, either online or through its stores . At the end of 2022, Tesla held 58% of the U.S. EV market, a figure that fell to 50.9% by 2023, then to 44.4% by 2024 .  The bears will argue that this is a consequence of a tired lineup of vehicles, amid concerns that Tesla is losing its competitive edge . The bulls will see it as an inevitable consequence of heavy investments by its competitors . Tesla investors may be willing to accept a decline in market share, but they won't want to see Tesla's automotive sales continue to decline .  Production of the Cybercab is due for volume production in 2026 . Lower-cost vehicles are an integral part of the case for robotaxis . Tesla needs to do this because it needs to lower unit costs of production .  Tesla's release of lower-cost models in 2025 could revitalize its lineup, start boosting sales, and capitalize on its position as a profitable EV maker with a cost structure that makes EVs more affordable to the mass public . Commercializing robotaxis will take time, and the Cybercab production ramp is understandably tied to that .  If you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $409,114!

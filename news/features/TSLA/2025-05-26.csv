For months, loyalists have been waiting excitedly for the electric vehicle (EV) producer to reveal its autonomous robotaxis in Austin, Texas . CEO Elon Musk has been touting these self-driving Teslas for years, and he claims they are on track for the June 2025 rollout .  Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives has long been highly bullish on Tesla’s growth prospects . Earlier this year, even Ives started expressing some skepticism about the company's future .

" AT&T's stock price has risen as the company refocused on its core telecom business . The company has maintained a generous payout since slashing the dividend in 2022 . Despite a modest valuation, investors will not necessarily consider its P/E ratio as inexpensive .  Since spinning off non-core businesses, AT&T more closely resembles its competitors . About 70% of its revenue comes from its mobility business in the U.S. and one-fourth from wireline enterprises . The company's $1.11-per-share annual payout has remained stable since the 2022 dividend cut .  AT&T expects steady growth, with revenue expected to rise by a low-single-digit percentage . It did not offer guidance on its profit increases, though consensus estimates point to an 8% pullback in profits before turning positive by 7% in 2026 . Still, such growth did not stop the company from generating over 65% in total returns over the last decade .  AT&T stock trades at a 17 P/E ratio compared to the S&P 500 average earnings multiple of 28 . Over the next year, the gains over the last two years are impressive, and over time, its stock should continue moving higher . It may also be an excellent buy for income-oriented investors, as a refocus on telecom has meant that its free cash flows can easily cover the dividend .  AT&T likely does not pay for investors to add shares at this time . A downturn in the near future is unlikely, making the stock a hold .

" The past two years were relatively tame compared to this year . The S&P 500 delivered back-to-back gains above 20% in 2023 and 2024 . This year, sticky inflation, job woes, and an ongoing tussle over tariffs have created uncertainty .  The S&P 500 collapsed from mid-February through early April, falling nearly 20%, just shy of bear market territory . Then, a tariff reprieve in the form of President Trump pausing most reciprocal tariffs on April 9 kicked off a major rally . Moody's decision to downgrade U.S. credit rating comes after a new spending and tax cuts bill that would cause the deficit to swell .  JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon says investors are still complacent about the Federal Reserve's monetary policy . The Fed is tasked with a dual mandate to ensure low unemployment and inflation . While unemployment has increased to 4.2% from 3.4% in 2023, inflation has proven sticky .  In March, there were 901,000 fewer unfilled jobs in the U.S., according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey . Over 600,000 workers have been laid off this year through April, up 87% year-over-year . The dynamic has increased the odds of stagflation, a period of elevated inflation and economic weakness .  The ongoing trade battle stresses financial markets, given how interdependent businesses have become across countries . Even at lower tariff rates, they will represent the largest new tax on consumers in decades . Even if tariffs eventually fall, they appear to be here to stay .  Dimon worries that people are far too complacent about the risk facing the U.S. economy . Dimon: ""People who haven’t been through a major downturn are missing the point"" The ""Big Beautiful Bill"" being debated in Washington could add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over 10 years .  JP Morgan's Jaime Dimon says the current situation has ""created a lot of risk out there"" Dimon also thinks there could be a major reset in corporate earnings this year because of tariffs . Dimon's candid take is simple: The current situation is not very reassuring . ""The good companies benefit from the downturn,"" he said .  Dec. 25, 2025, will be 25 years old in 2025 . It will be 50 years old when it turns out to be the year of the year 2025 .",negative,"tariffs, inflation, deficit, tariff, unemployment"

" TKO Group Holdings (TKO,Financial) could be the most exciting name in entertainment that you are not paying enough attention to . Growing from the merger between Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) TKO entered the new year swinging, with increasing revenue, expanding global audience, and a newly earned S&P 500 ticket . Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with TKO .  First-quarter revenue for the company came in at $1.27 billion, a decent 4% increase year-over-year . WWE was a star, up 24% to $391.5 million, due to increased SmackDown and hype before WrestleMania 41 in Europe . UFC wasn't that far behind either, increasing 15% with the help of overseas events .  TKO's first quarter tells the story of a company actively growing its empire in sports and entertainment . Net income turned into the black at $165.5 million, a gargantuan improvement on last year's loss . Full-year revenue projections now stand between $4.49 billion and $4 .56 billion . The company has recently acquired IMG, On Location, andProfessional Bull Riders .  S&P 500 status allows passive purchase from the world's biggest funds, like Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, all of which track the index . TKO is on an expansion streak and it's nailing it in tech, sports, and global reach .  TKO is entering the boxing ring, literally, with a new promotion that it has formed with Saudi Arabia's Sela, supported by the mighty Public Investment Fund . The move is a bold departure from UFC and WWE and leverages the existing fan base of TKO . Dana White says it is a game-changer and he could be right .  TKO is going big in international expansion, exporting its blockbuster shows to new global fans, and strengthening ties in one of the most important Asia-Pacific markets . Western Australian Government will host five key events this year, including a UFC Fight Night at RAC Arena .  WWE has rolled out Evolve on Tubi (FOX), and LFG on A&E (Disney) Both platforms will put the spotlight on up-and-comers from the Indies (ID) and Next-In-Line (NIL) college athlete pools . TKO's collection of media rights is proving to be a versatile and profitable asset .  TKO started to pay a cash dividend on a quarterly basis, from its first ex-date on 14th March 2025, and first payment on 31st March . The company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.38, yielding an annual payout of $1.52 and a payout ratio of only 17.08% .  TKO Group's valuation certainly catches the eye, although not necessarily and entirely in a good way . For the non-GAAP trailing P/E ratio, it is over 50 times when compared to a sector median of approximately 12 . Even going forward, it remains up near 46. That is more than triple the price most of its peers are trading at .  TKO is priced as a firm that has something to prove in a major way . The PEG ratio based on non-GAAP forward earnings is a modest 0.16 times . Earnings are expected to ramp up fast in the next few years . This optimistic prognosis could be used to rationalize the current premium .  Analysts are expecting TKO's valuation to normalize as well with forward P/E falling from 47.05x in 2025 to around 24x in 2026 . The revenue is expected to rise to $4.47 billion, an increase of almost 59% in the same year . This is a solid indication that the market is confident in the market's scaling ability and varied revenue streams .  TKO Group is not the only one with a premium valuation, but it does stand out . Live Nation (LYV) and Liberty Media's Formula One Group (FWONK) both come with high multiples . TKO's forward P/E non-GAAP (FY1) lags LYV's 67.14 times and FWONK's 51.71 times .  TKO Group enjoys an excellent run having gained 15.24% year-to-date and 56.5% in a year . There are 19 analysts that have provided 12-month price targets for ADS, with a mean target of $174.89, implying about 6.3% upside from the current $164.5 .  Analysts expect 357% increase in EPS next year, and strong double-digit growth for the next two years . Revenues are also poised to rocket, and valuation multiples will be under pressure to contract . A realistic 12-month price target for TKO could be anywhere between $185$190 .  In the last three years, the insiders have bought approximately 13 million shares but sold almost 17 million . That's buying rate of about 76% over selling which is quite high compared to the rest of the public companies where buying is negligible or does not exist . No insider sales in the last 3 months while there are still purchases. This pattern indicates a sense of confidence from management and the key stakeholders .  Names such as Renaissance Technologies don't simply buy into hype; they're associated with value-conscious strategies . Ray Dalio acquired additional 26.8% of the shares, and Louis Moore Bacon increased his stake by 1625% .  TKO-EDR merger achieved increased leverage for the company . With substantial debt, Endeavor paid for the merger, leaving TKO with substantial debt . While TKO has the cash to cover payouts, it's currently paying out more than it's generating in net profits .  TKO Group is finding its feet in all areas, combining sports, entertainment, tech, and world conquest into a powerful growth vehicle . The company's strong Q1 results, the UFC and WWE momentum that is booming, and a constant stream of catalysts position the company to have a hard-to-ignore story .  TKO is a high-risk, high-reward play with massive potential . Execution risk is real and the premium pricing allows for little room to make mistakes . TKO could be a main-event performer in the making .",positive,"tko, ufc, revenues, earnings, wwe"

" Intel's revenue is a cause of concern as in 2022, 2023, and 2024, it had declines in sales of 20.2%, 14%, and 2.1%, respectively . In the profitability side, the company went from a mid-30% net income range in 2019 to a 7.2% loss in 2024 . This reveals difficulties in pricing its products competitively and a massive capital expenditure related to manufacturing expansion .  On server side, performance benchmarks show that the new Granite Rapids platform outperforms the competition . This shows a much-needed technical upgrade from past versions, where they consistently fell behind AMD .  Intel's processors consume up to 38% more power than AMD's EPYC 9684X Genoa-X 2P processor . This is something Intel should improve, and investors should keep an eye on . Competition against NVIDIA is yet to be seen as the ecosystem for NVIDIA is now the most robust .  With the new tariffs implemented and the ever-increasing tensions, domestic production of high-performance chips is growing in importance . Taiwan, where TSMC is located, has been constantly under the risk of annexation by China and will be one of the first places to be invaded in a case of escalation .

Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy aims to restore manufacturing leadership while simultaneously building a foundry services business . AMD, Apple, and NVIDIA will use TSMC's plants in the US, Intel is building its own . This reduces costs, keeps earnings local, and avoids the risk of being overloaded with orders or plagiarizing technology .  Intel's balance sheet has deteriorated as the company funds its manufacturing transformation . Long-term debt increased substantially, from $33 billion in 2020 to over $46 billion by 2024 . The company's decision to cut its dividend by 66% in early 2023 signaled the financial pressure created by its capital-intensive strategy .  AMD has leveraged TSMC's manufacturing advantages to deliver superior performance per watt, increasing its server market share from single digits to 33% by Q1Y2024 . Nvidia with its GPUs being more efficient for AI applications, has completely dominated the AI accelerator market, with Intel's efforts in this high-growth segment .  Intel represents a high-risk, potentially high-reward investment proposition . With current levels of instability at an all-time high across most industries, the stock price presents a strong appeal .

EasyJet started out in 1995 as a Boeing operator but switched to Airbus in 2002 with an order for 120 A319s . Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou secured a discount that undercut the US manufacturer by 30pc .

Coupang introduced 510% discounts on Eats orders for WOW members . Coupang Play, the company's video streaming arm, is another point of the ecosystem aimed at increasing customer engagement . Bundled with WOW membership, it offers a mix of licensed and original programming .  Coupang has found that WOW members who engage with multiple services have much higher retention and spend . Management has indicatedthat Coupang Play's engagement model is one they intend to replicate in other markets . Coupang Pay leverages its built-in user base to streamline the checkout process .  Coupang entered Taiwan in mid-2021, bringing Rocket Delivery to a market underserved by global e-commerce giants . With its tech-savvy population of 24 million and cultural parallels to South Korea, it has emerged as a more natural fit for Coupang's logistics-driven model .  Taiwan's e-commerce market was valued at approximately $19.6 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow to $26.8 billion by 2028 . Management has stated that they expect Coupang's Taiwanese operations to reach profitability faster than in South Korea .  Farfetch is a global luxury fashion marketplace that connects consumers to high-end boutiques and premium brands around the world . Coupang is well-positioned to enhance delivery speed and reliability for high-value goods .  In Q1 2025, management reported that Farfetch was nearing breakeven, an important milestone for a business that had been deeply unprofitable . 2025 is likely to be a year of synergy realization . I expect Coupang to explore cross-platform integrations .  Coupang's Q1 2025 results highlight a business that continues to grow at a healthy pace while expanding its margin profile . Net revenue reached $7.9 billion, up 11% YoY or 21% in constant currency . Gross profit climbed 20% to $2.3 billion, lifting gross margin by 217 basis points to 29.3% .  There were some one-off factors affecting YoY cash flow comparisons . Free cash flow rose to $144 million (including net borrowing) in the quarter, a 38% YoY increase . Over the trailing twelve months, Coupang generated $2.0 billion in cash from operations .  The Developing Offerings segment posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of $168 million, an $18 million improvement from the prior year . It's also notable that Coupang's board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program, its first since going public .  Coupang trades at a price to sales (P/S) multiple of 1.6x, while Amazon trades at 3.4x, Alibaba at 2.0x, and Sea at 5.3x . Coupang's valuation reflects a combination of earlier-stage profitability and what I believe is a Korea discount . I estimate a fair value of around $32 per share, suggesting a potential 20% upside from current levels .  Dodge & Cox doubled its stake in Coupang last quarter and now holds approximately 2.25% of the shares outstanding . Baillie Gifford(Trades,Portfolio) maintains Coupang among its top ten holdings, despite a modest 3.6% trim .  Coupang's logistics moat is difficult to replicate, any meaningful service-level improvements from incumbents could slow its momentum . Baemin, still the market leader, benefits from scale and brand familiarity, but Coupang Eats is gaining quickly . Coupang Play competes with global platforms like Netflix and Disney+ .  Coupang Pay operates in a crowded and fragmented digital payments landscape alongside Kakao Pay, Naver Pay, and traditional credit cards . The focus isn't on market dominance, but on streamlining transactions and capturing data to enhance the broader ecosystem . Shopee remains the dominant platform, with strong brand equity and logistical reach .  Coupang continues to show why it's more than just a dominant e-commerce player in Korea . Risks remain, particularly around competition, execution in new markets, regulatory scrutiny, and macro volatility .  Coupang is building an ecosystem that increases customer lifetime value and operates with a mindset of continual innovation . I believe if Coupang maintains its current level of execution and operating leverage, it has the potential to be a long-term market beater .",positive,"coupang, commerce, alibaba, marketplace, korea"

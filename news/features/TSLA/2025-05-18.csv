" Tesla essentially created the electric vehicle industry, forcing automakers to adapt . The growth of EVs is expected to create a 9,000% increase in demand for electricity from EVs . Big beneficiaries will be utilities like NextEra Energy, Black Hills, and Dominion Energy .  Between 2020 and 2040, electricity demand is expected to grow by more than $1 billion . That growth will be fueled by the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) Electric cars and other technologies are expected to increase demand .  Electric utilities demand is projected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2020 . The growth is going to be driven in the near term by AI, which is expected to see an increase in demand of 300% over 10 years . The longer term will be driven by EVs, which are projected to see a 9,000% increase in electricity demand by 2050 . For those with a dividend growth approach, NextEra Energy is probably the best choice .  Black Hills is one of the few utilities that has managed to achieve Dividend King status, with its 55 annual dividend increases . The company is actually two businesses in one, with the foundation built upon its regulated utility operations in Florida and the growth coming from its large renewable power operations .  NextEra Energy has spent years slimming down its business to become a pure-play electricity provider . It's a low-risk turnaround story for investors who are happy to collect an above-average yield while they wait for better days .  NextEra Energy stands out on the dividend growth front, Black Hills for dividend reliability, and Dominion Energy for its turnaround appeal . Now is the best time to buy before it’s too late .

" Li Auto (LI) may not dominate headlines like Tesla, but perhaps it should . In 2024 alone, the company delivered over 500,000 vehicles, expanded its global R&D presence, and continued scaling China’s largest highway fast-charging network .  Most of Li Auto’s lineup consists of family-oriented SUVs, with increasing emphasis on autonomous driving capabilities, advanced software integration, and driver assistance systems . The company now operates over 500 retail locations and employs more than 32,000 people .  The company currently operates 1,420 highway fast-charging stations and aims to grow that number to 4,000 by year-end . In Q4 2024, net income declined 39% year-over-year, and gross margins slipped from 23.5% to 20.3% Management attributed this margin pressure to the ongoing ramp-up in batteryelectric vehicle production .  Li Auto boasts a rock-solid balance sheet with ¥112.8 billion in cash on hand . Unlike XPeng, NIO, and Rivian, which are still unprofitable, Li Auto trades at a more grounded multiple while maintaining profitability . Tesla commands a significantly higher multiple at around 60x forward earnings .  Li Auto’s average stock price target of $33.70implies approximately 18% upside potential over the next 12 months . Battery electric vehicle (BEV) adoption remains in its early stages, with demand still developing and far from guaranteed . If consumer uptake falls short, margins could come under pressure, especially if rivals use this uncertain period to close gap on more established players .  The electric vehicle sector is set to remain one of the market’s most dynamic—and volatile—corners . Companies straddle the line between traditional automotive fundamentals and high-growth, software-driven potential . While Li Auto faces short-term challenges and broader macroeconomic uncertainty, its robust balance sheet, promising product lineup and potentially attractive valuation make it a compelling prospect for forward-looking investors .

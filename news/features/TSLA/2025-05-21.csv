" Tesla's compensation has been hung up in court for seven years and is now pending Musk and Tesla's appeal . Delaware's Chancery Court invalidated the $56 billion-plus performance-based deal . Tesla dissolved its incorporation in Delaware and reincorporated in Texas .  Tesla's decision to stay at Tesla is less about pay, and more about gaining more control over the company, Musk said . Musk described the judge who invalidated his pay, Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, as an “activist who is playing a judge in a Halloween costume .  Delaware's interpretation of independence is strict, Gadinis says . Texas courts are not bound to follow Delaware's law, he says . The Delaware court's concern about board independence in Musk's case was elevated because Musk's influence over its board was considered substantial .  Delaware amended its corporate law to specify that shareholders like Musk who control less than one-third of a company's shares are not considered controlling shareholders . Lawyer: ""The case is likely to influence how other boards approach executive compensation""  Texas law is “fairly flexible” when it comes to C-suite pay arrangements . Neither state nor federal laws are flexible enough to go back in time and reinstate Musk’s disputed plan . Tesla stockholders approved Musk's pay-performance-based package a second time in June .  The options that cost Tesla $2.3 billion in 2018, if reissued today, would carry an accounting charge to Tesla of roughly $50 billion . Gadinis said it's unlikely that a purely performance-based award would get Musk back to the same compensation level .  An in-the-money pay plan could grant Musk the right to options at the same price per share awarded in his original deal . But to work legally, the options must have dates on which they would automatically vest . Otherwise, a 20% excise tax would apply, on top of normal income taxes .  A single Tesla shareholder undid Musk's pay in a lawsuit that alleged that Tesla's board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the plan . Restricted options are not required to have an exercise price, and simply confer the right to purchase the shares at a set ""strike"" or ""exercise"" price after vesting .  Tesla's new compensation committee includes Wilson-Thompson and board chair Robyn Denholm, who has made roughly $530 million in Tesla share sale profits since taking her board chair position in 2018 . University of Colorado finance professor Sanjai Bhagat said that any alternate compensation plan should restrict Musk from immediately selling shares or exercising options .  Gadinis: Despite flaws, Musk's pay deal fulfilled the point of CEO compensation . Gadinis said the only time in Tesla's compensation plan that Musk gets anything out of it is if the shareholders get something from it . A new pay plan under Texas law would still require that Tesla publicly disclose its pay proposal to shareholders .  A new Texas law makes it more difficult for a shareholder dispute to go forward in Texas . Tesla amended its bylaws last week to reflect the change . Musk moved the incorporation for his rocket-building company, SpaceX, from Delaware to Texas .  Management,Trade Desk,Fidelity National Financial, andSonoma Pharmaceuticals have all floated plans to move their incorporations . Delaware's new governor has amended its corporation laws . The law extends more leeway to board members in transactions where their interests or relationships raise conflicts of interest .

" Tesla's compensation has been hung up in court for seven years and is now pending Musk and Tesla's appeal . Delaware's Chancery Court invalidated the $56 billion-plus performance-based deal . Tesla dissolved its incorporation in Delaware and reincorporated in Texas .  Tesla's decision to stay at Tesla is less about pay, and more about gaining more control over the company, Musk said . Musk described the judge who invalidated his pay, Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, as an “activist who is playing a judge in a Halloween costume .  Delaware's interpretation of independence is strict, Gadinis says . Texas courts are not bound to follow Delaware's law, he says . The Delaware court's concern about board independence in Musk's case was elevated because Musk's influence over its board was considered substantial .  Delaware amended its corporate law to specify that shareholders like Musk who control less than one-third of a company's shares are not considered controlling shareholders . Lawyer: ""The case is likely to influence how other boards approach executive compensation""  Texas law is “fairly flexible” when it comes to C-suite pay arrangements . Neither state nor federal laws are flexible enough to go back in time and reinstate Musk’s disputed plan . Tesla stockholders approved Musk's pay-performance-based package a second time in June .  The options that cost Tesla $2.3 billion in 2018, if reissued today, would carry an accounting charge to Tesla of roughly $50 billion . Gadinis said it's unlikely that a purely performance-based award would get Musk back to the same compensation level .  An in-the-money pay plan could grant Musk the right to options at the same price per share awarded in his original deal . But to work legally, the options must have dates on which they would automatically vest . Otherwise, a 20% excise tax would apply, on top of normal income taxes .  A single Tesla shareholder undid Musk's pay in a lawsuit that alleged that Tesla's board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the plan . Restricted options are not required to have an exercise price, and simply confer the right to purchase the shares at a set ""strike"" or ""exercise"" price after vesting .  Tesla's new compensation committee includes Wilson-Thompson and board chair Robyn Denholm, who has made roughly $530 million in Tesla share sale profits since taking her board chair position in 2018 . University of Colorado finance professor Sanjai Bhagat said that any alternate compensation plan should restrict Musk from immediately selling shares or exercising options .  Gadinis: Despite flaws, Musk's pay deal fulfilled the point of CEO compensation . Gadinis said the only time in Tesla's compensation plan that Musk gets anything out of it is if the shareholders get something from it . A new pay plan under Texas law would still require that Tesla publicly disclose its pay proposal to shareholders .  A new Texas law makes it more difficult for a shareholder dispute to go forward in Texas . Tesla amended its bylaws last week to reflect the change . Musk moved the incorporation for his rocket-building company, SpaceX, from Delaware to Texas .  Management,Trade Desk,Fidelity National Financial, andSonoma Pharmaceuticals have all floated plans to move their incorporations . Delaware's new governor has amended its corporation laws . The law extends more leeway to board members in transactions where their interests or relationships raise conflicts of interest .  A recent regulatory filing from Tesla said it would delay the filing of its proxy statement . That could give Tesla more time to work out a backup pay plan for Musk .

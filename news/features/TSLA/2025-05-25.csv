With approximately 900 million active shoppers in China, Alibaba retains an unmatched scale advantage . International e-commerce platforms delivered 22% revenue growth in the fourth quarter .

The defining moment of every four-year cycle is the Bitcoin halving, which takes place every four years .

Our fiscal year '26 outlook is informed by our current assessment of the many factors that will drive performance . This includes anticipated growth in our Defense and Intel businesses and a near-term reset of our Civil portfolio . We expect to deliver revenue between $12 billion and $12.5 billion .  Full year adjusted EBITDA margin of about 11% on par with fiscal year 2025 . Free cash flow to be between $700 million and $800 million . ADEPS to be in the range of $6.20 per share .  Booz Allen continues to transform. Could not be prouder of how we finished fiscal year 2025, the final year of our investment thesis. We remain very optimistic about the future.  As we look at the world now, we are seeing two sets of overlapping dynamics . One set of dynamics is, as we said in the prepared remarks, our Civil business is going through this what we hope, we believe, will be a onetime reset . The other side of the dynamic is continued strength in Defense business and growing strength in our Intelligence business .  Defense and Intel are still winning work against a strong procurement environment . Even in Civil, we're beginning to see opportunities take shape that we will take advantage of . We're in a position to absorb things there as well and continue strong growth vector as we see it .  Maybe if we could talk about some of the comments you made around kind of reset and what your expectation is on the multiyear growth environment . Maybe just kind of digging into how you think about kind of Defense and Civil and kind of where we stand on the reality of FY25 sub versus FY26 request? Kind of what you're hearing from congressional folks? And then also maybe, Matt, if you could . talk about how you're think about repurchases and what the bogey is for the year? Horacio Rozanski .  The bill that is making its way to the Senate, as we speak, has a significant plus up for defense . Doubling down on priorities around into Pacific, where, as you know, Booz Allen has a very strong footprint .  Booz Allen has been very excited about the opportunity to present our ideas to the government . The discussion has moved away from whether AI was important to national security to how fast can we implement AI in national security .  The balance sheet continues to be a strength of ours. We deployed $1.2 billion last year and basically maintained leverage. Gavin, I'll take your balance sheet capital deployment question. We are anticipating that our counterterrorism expertise will position us really well against the sophisticated threat. And we have also presented very big bold ideas there as well and are in discussions around them.  We've shown that we will buy back our shares, we believe that it's good value for shareholders . We're still committed to M&A, more biased to tuck-in than ever, given how rapidly the technology market is changing .  The vast majority, as Horacio mentioned, of our Civil programs have already been reviewed . Kristine Anderson: We're committed to deploying capital, share repurchases obviously is an important lever there . Matthew Calderone: Can you speak a little louder?  Government agencies are looking at their full portfolio with targets in mind . Agency-driven reviews are agency-driven, and our tech and talent fared really well in those reviews . But there has been a short-term slowdown in the actual burn rates .  Horacio Rozanski: Our thought process is we wanted to do a onetime reset and restructuring of our Civil business so it can regain a growth trajectory as quickly as possible . The procurement environment has slowed down significantly, almost frozen a number of these agencies because the below cabinet level positions have not been filled .  How do we think about the down 7% in Q1 for headcount? I think that was total company, but very heavily concentrated in our Civil business . I think look, our business is changing. And there are three dynamics where -- or three areas where the traditional algorithm may look a little different than what we've experienced in the past .  We're actually winning a lot of work, right? Our book-to-bill last quarter was 0.7 times, very much in line with historical averages . Conversion of backlog and bookings to near-term revenue, I think, will be a little bit more variable than we've seen in the past just because there's less consistency in sort of in-year spending actions .  Typically, the algorithm is headcount growth plus 3% . But the preponderance of the headcount reductions we are seeing is in our Civil business . Civil business is less -- it's more fixed price, it's less dependent on billing by the hour .  Every month, we're adding hundreds of employees. We do expect to have significant headcount in the second year. And we have really matured our AI-enabled advanced tech solution. And so we're looking to be even more effective at that this year.  I think I'll say it that we are the preferred player in terms of helping these commercial solutions get missionized in a way that they make sense . I think this is why we have built partnerships and made investments all the way from hyperscalers to the start-ups and everything and everyone in between .  Booz Allen has a branding issue, Ronald Epstein says . It does seem like, at least perceptional, that you guys have a branding problem . Ronald Epstein: It's a net positive to Booz .  Allen pops up all over the place. Seemingly, at least from my vantage point, that seems unfair. But that being said, that seemed unfair. And what we do about it is we're -- we've gotten a lot better at telling our story. I think that's resonated. We tend to be relatively humble and quiet about our own communications .  Louie Dipalma: I think we're emerging from that transition with our brand, ultimately it's going to be strengthened as a result of all of the scrutiny . You have several large AI contracts, including the joint Warfighter National Mission Initiative eMAPS 2.0 and Advana .  Booz Allen's AI business has grown to over $800 million . The question now is how quickly how do you bring the right technologies? How do you make commercial technology, both safe, reliable and secure enough to use it against some of these missions .  The move to Agentic AI is going to be transformational for the global economy, for America and certainly for our national security missions . And we've done some stuff on our own research side that is really breakthrough physical AI, which is sort of the key to autonomy .  Louie Dipalma: I am extraordinarily optimistic about the future of AI and Booz Allen's role in it . We have now upgraded our presence in AI in space by moving Space LlAMA to the research side of the International Space Station .  Horacio Rozanski: I think the reason that these programs have been so successful is that we took the best commercial technology and work that we've done and technology that we built to create complete solutions that really address mission needs . And I think these programs are standing the test of both the quality of what they're providing and the impact on mission .  Horacio Rozanski: Government programs are ripe given the nature of what we do . He says outcome-based contracting is the future of government contracting . Rozanski says the industry is fragmented .  Booz Allen is strategically advantaged because a lot of the things that we did under whole are really becoming essential now to delivering the mission . We are being aggressive. We are not standing still to continue to position and reposition ourselves and drive shareholder value .  Nonclient-facing headcount was down 100 people quarter-over-quarter . Scott Mikus: Is there upside to the margin or EBITDA guidance if you reduce that headcount more? Do you get to keep those savings? Or do they end up being passed back to the customer? Matthew Calderone: We've been, I think, aggressively managing the totality of our Civil business .  Historically, our solar business, because it is more fixed price in nature, has been more profitable than the average . So we're really pleased that we're able to manage our cost base in a way that we'll maintain margins even while we're resetting our Civil business, but also the capacity to invest and grow .  Horacio Rozanski: We're strategically positioned for a era of tech-driven growth . And we're doubling down on what Booz Allen does best, using advanced technology to keep America strong and safe .",neutral,"earnings, quarterly, financial, rozanski, allen"
